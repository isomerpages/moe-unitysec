| <img src="/images/bball logo.png" style="width:30%"><br><br>The aim of Unity Basketball Girls Co-Curriculum Activity (CCA) is to build character, team spirit, resilience and responsibility in students. Through the training program provided by Unity Basketball Girls CCA, the experiences will help students discover for themselves their strengths, which we hope to develop them to their full potential. Basketball also foster social integration and develop in students a sense of belonging and camaraderie. We hope that the enriching Basketball experiences will allow the students to emerge strong in character, grounded in sound moral values, equipped with competencies, and ready for the challenges in their adult life.  <br><br>Unity Basketball Girls CCA would organize Annual Overseas Training Trip twice a year. The Unity Basketball Girl Team had been to Johor, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China in the past three years where they had an enriching experience learning about the history, culture and education system of the other countries. The students also had matches with the top sporting schools in the city/country that allowed our students to be exposed to opponents of higher caliber and different playing styles. In addition, training sessions with reputable coaches in the city/country were organized to impart our students with valuable knowledge and skills of the game. All these experiences allowed our students to develop a greater appreciation of the game and broadened their perspectives on how to excel in the sport. |
