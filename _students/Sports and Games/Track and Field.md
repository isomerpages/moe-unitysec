| Unity Track and Field has been actively participating in the National Schools Track and Field and the National Schools Cross Country for the past 10 years. Even though there are individual events, there is an emphasis on team training.  <br><br>Our Track motto is&nbsp;**C.A.P.**&nbsp;_C_&nbsp;for Commitment,&nbsp;_A_&nbsp;for Attitude and&nbsp;_P_&nbsp;for Perseverance. We also believe in developing leadership in the most committed students and believe every student is a potential leader. |
