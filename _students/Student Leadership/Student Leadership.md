<h1>Student Leadership</h1>
<h2>Student Leadership Development in Unity</h2>
<p>In line with&nbsp;<em>Strategic Thrust 3</em>&nbsp;– Every student, an
Inspiring Leader, the school has been intentional in imparting values and
cultivating leadership competencies and dispositions in all our students,
in preparation for them to thrive and make a positive impact and difference
in their sphere of influence.</p>
<p>The school adopted the Student Leadership Challenge by Jim Kouzes and
Barry Posner. We use the 5 leadership practices to train our students.</p>

<p><strong>Our Student Leadership Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that every student can be developed to be a leader. The structure
for student leadership in Unity is illustrated in the diagram below:</p>

<p>At Tier 1, all Unitians are imparted with self management and self regulation
skills to grow them to be&nbsp;<strong>Leaders of Self</strong>. Students
also learn more about the Student Leadership Challenge through meaningful
discussions during Student Leadership CCE lessons and CCA throughout the
year. They will deepen their understanding of the five Student Leadership
Challenge practices in Secondary Two. Selected lower secondary students
may have the opportunity to be appointed as the lower secondary committee
members.</p>
<p>At Tier 2, all Sec 3 students are developed to be&nbsp;<strong>Leaders of Teams</strong>&nbsp;where
they will receive more targeted training to give them exposure and experience
on working with diverse groups of people. They will apply the five Student
Leadership Challenge practices through planning of CCA activities and school
events.</p>
<p>At Tier 3, all the Presidents of each CCA, will be developed to be&nbsp;<strong>Leaders of Leaders</strong>.
They will form the Unity Council, to represent the different segments of
students' voices in the school, engage in meaningful conversations with
the school management team and influence decision making across wide-ranging
aspects of their learning and learning environment in the school. They
also engage the CCA leaders to collectively influence the development of
school rules, policies and make improvement to the student-related activities.
Besides working with fellow student leaders within the Student Council,
they are also given opportunities to reach out and collaborate with the
community.</p>
