Student Leadership Development in Unity
---------------------------------------

  
In line with _Strategic Thrust 3_ – Every student, an Inspiring Leader, the school has been intentional in imparting values and cultivating leadership competencies and dispositions in all our students, in preparation for them to thrive and make a positive impact and difference in their sphere of influence.  
  
The school adopted the Student Leadership Challenge by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner. We use the 5 leadership practices to train our students.

**Our Student Leadership Framework**  
  
We believe that every student can be developed to be a leader. The structure for student leadership in Unity is illustrated in the diagram below:

At Tier 1, all Unitians are imparted with self management and self regulation skills to grow them to be **Leaders of Self**. Students also learn more about the Student Leadership Challenge through meaningful discussions during Student Leadership CCE lessons and CCA throughout the year. They will deepen their understanding of the five Student Leadership Challenge practices in Secondary Two. Selected lower secondary students may have the opportunity to be appointed as the lower secondary committee members.  
  
At Tier 2, all Sec 3 students are developed to be **Leaders of Teams** where they will receive more targeted training to give them exposure and experience on working with diverse groups of people. They will apply the five Student Leadership Challenge practices through planning of CCA activities and school events.  
  
At Tier 3, all the Presidents of each CCA, will be developed to be **Leaders of Leaders**. They will form the Unity Council, to represent the different segments of students' voices in the school, engage in meaningful conversations with the school management team and influence decision making across wide-ranging aspects of their learning and learning environment in the school. They also engage the CCA leaders to collectively influence the development of school rules, policies and make improvement to the student-related activities. Besides working with fellow student leaders within the Student Council, they are also given opportunities to reach out and collaborate with the community.
