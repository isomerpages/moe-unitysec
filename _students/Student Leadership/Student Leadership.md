Student Leadership Development in Unity

In line with _Strategic Thrust 3_ – Every student, an Inspiring Leader, the school has been intentional in imparting values and cultivating leadership competencies and dispositions in all our students, in preparation for them to thrive and make a positive impact and difference in their sphere of influence.  
  
The school adopted the Student Leadership Challenge by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner. We use the 5 leadership practices to train our students.
