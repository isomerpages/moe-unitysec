<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>At Unity Secondary School, our Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) play a vital
role in shaping a caring and enabling school environment. Guided by the
vision of a community where every student feels valued, accepted, and respected,
PSLs are the heartbeat of peer support and relations in each class.</p>
<p>More than just leaders, PSLs are role models of compassion and respect.
They bridge connections among classmates, promote well-being through meaningful
class engagements, and nurture a sense of belonging built on care, trust,
and respect.</p>
<h3><strong>The Role of PSLs</strong></h3>
<p>🫱🏼‍🫲🏽 Attend PSL meetings and workshops (2–3 times per month, every
Tuesday or Friday)
<br>📣 Facilitate class or school-level sharing on peer support and relations
(PSR)
<br>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Lead class engagement activities that build a positive classroom
climate
<br>💪 Support peers actively in class and CCA settings
<br>❤️ Include and reach out to classmates proactively
<br>🔒 Model accountability and integrity among peers
<br>🎡 Plan and execute school-wide events promoting wellness and inclusion</p>
<h3><strong>Our Structure and Programmes</strong></h3>
<p>To meet the diverse needs of students, the PSL Programme is organised
into three tiers of support, each led by PSLs and guided by teacher mentors.</p>

<p>Together, these efforts ensure that every student has access to meaningful
peer connection and support — from general community-building to targeted
care for students with greater needs.</p>
<h3><strong>Selection and Probation Process</strong></h3>
<p>Each class nominates PSLs based on teacher endorsement. Character Coaches
select representatives by Term 1 Week 5, with all new PSLs placed on a
Semester 1 probation period.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria
<br>&nbsp;Attendance • Punctuality • Positive Peer Support Behaviours • Active
Participation</p>
<p>At the end of Semester 1, PSLs who meet expectations are formally inducted.
Inducted PSLs are expected to uphold the team’s commitment and values throughout
the year.
<br>&nbsp;Those who do not meet expectations will step down, ensuring that
only the most committed and reliable students continue serving as PSLs.</p>
<p>This structure ensures continuity, consistency, and excellence in leadership
across all classes.</p>
