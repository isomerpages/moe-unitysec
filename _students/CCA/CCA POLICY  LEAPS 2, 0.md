<h2>CCA POLICY- LEAPS 2.0</h2>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<h4>The Unity CCA Framework</h4>
<p>Our school offers a broad-based and ability-driven CCA programme that
will help to develop and maximise the potential and talents of our youth
beyond the academic aspect. Our CCA programme strives to complement different
areas of education in achieving the Desired Outcomes of Education. The
framework of our CCA programme seeks to inculcate Team Spirit, Character
Building, Leadership, Ruggedness and Gracefulness in all our students.</p>
<h4>CCA Policy&nbsp;</h4>
<h5>CCA Policy For LEAPS 2.0</h5>
<p>LEAPS 2.0 is a framework to recognise secondary school students’ holistic
development. Students will be recognised with levels of attainment in four
domains: Participation, Achievement, Leadership and Service.</p>
<p>1 . <em>Participation</em>
<br>This domain recognises students’ participation in one school-based Co-Curricular
Activity (CCA). Recognition is based on the number of years of participation
and exemplary conduct and active contribution to the CCA. Sustained engagement
in the same CCA allows for progressive development of character, skills,
knowledge and friendships, and will be accorded higher recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 . <em>Service</em>
<br>This domain recognises students’ development as socially responsible citizens
who contribute meaningfully to the community. Every secondary school student
will contribute at least 6 hours per school year to the community. They
can choose to embark on a Values-In-Action project (VIA). Students will
be recognised for the time they put into planning, service and reflection,
when participating in a VIA project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 . <em>Leadership</em>
<br>This domain recognises students’ leadership development. Recognition is
accorded to students’ ability to take charge of personal development, work
in a team and assume responsibilities in service of others. In addition
to formal leadership appointments, participation in student leadership
modules/workshops, the National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) and leadership
positions in the school, CCA or student-initiated/student-led projects
will also be recognised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4 . <em>Achievement</em>
<br>This domain recognises students’ representation and accomplishment in
co-curricular involvements beyond the classroom. Opportunities for representation
and accomplishment present valuable learning experiences for students to
learn discipline, resilience and develop their character. Students may
represent the school or organisations endorsed by the school. Recognising
external opportunities better caters to students’ diverse interests and
talents. It also recognises the community’s role in developing the child.</p>
<p>Representation refers to being&nbsp;<strong><em>selected and endorsed by the school or an organisation endorsed by the school</em></strong>(e.g.
the community club or national association) to contribute, perform or compete.
It need not be tied to his/her CCA in school.</p>
<p>Accomplishment refers to attaining accolades and awards at competitions,
festivals, performances, exhibitions, conferences and symposiums where
the student represents the school or other organisations endorsed by the
school.</p>
<p>The details on the levels of attainment for each of the domains are attached
at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unitysec.moe.edu.sg/CCA.html#AnnexA" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annex A</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition of Students’ Level of Attainment</strong>
</p>
<p>At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment
will be recognised according to Excellent/Good/Fair. The level of attainment
will be converted to a bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to
Junior Colleges/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of Education (JC/Poly/ITE).</p>
