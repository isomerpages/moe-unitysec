## Full Subject Based Banding

<u>Purpose of Full SBB</u>

Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students. With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life. This is in line with our belief in providing opportunities for all our students.

<u>Implementation of Full SBB in 2024</u>

By 2024, all secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:

*     Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum; and
*     Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2.

Unity Secondary School will be implementing Full SBB in 2024.

*        **_Mixed Form Classes_**

To kick off our Full SBB journey, the 2022 cohort of Secondary 1 students will be grouped in form classes based on their CCAs.

Our school sees CCAs as an organic platform for students to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests. It presents opportunities for students to mingle, build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives. The mixed-class grouping can also help reduce the inadvertent labelling associated with streaming through carefully designed student development experiences.

The CCA-centric structure will also present opportunities for students’ to develop their leadership competencies as senior CCA leaders will act as mentors to their junior CCA peers. Such experiences will instill in students a sense of belonging and responsibility to the school and community.

Under this new grouping, the CCA teachers will be the students’ Character Coaches. The role of the Character Coaches is to ensure the total well-being and character development of the students. They will also monitor the students’ academic progress and school attendance during both curriculum and CCA time. In our school, every Friday is set aside as ‘Character Day’ for CCA trainings and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons which will be conducted by the Character Coaches.

*        **_Common Curriculum at Lower Secondary_**

Besides CCE lessons, all Sec 1 students will attend lessons for the following common curriculum subjects in mixed classes: Music, Physical Education, Art, Design and Technology as well as Food and Consumer Education. This will allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.

The Common Curriculum subjects are designed to ensure accessibility to all students. There will be common curriculum coverage and assessment tasks & rubrics that will allow all students to meet each subject’s requirements.

*        **_Subject Based Banding_**

All Sec 1 Students will have opportunities to do English Language, Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria.

*        **_For Geography, History, Literature, Computer Applications_**

Students will attend lessons based on their subject classes. The subject classes will be organised based on their respective course levels i.e N(T), N(A) or Express. _\[\* Unity Secondary School will implement FSBB in 2024\]_
