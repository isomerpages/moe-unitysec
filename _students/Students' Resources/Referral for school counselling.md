<h2>Referral for school counselling</h2>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>School Counselling is an integral part of the Pastoral Care programme
in Unity Secondary School. For the development of our students into healthy
and effective individuals, their social-emotional development is as crucial
as their physical and intellectual developments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>School Counselling offers support for students who are:</p>
<p>a. dealing with the challenges at school or at home
<br>b. interested in understanding themselves better
<br>c. experiencing relationship difficulties
<br>d. feeling depressed or anxious
<br>e. experiencing loss or bereavement
<br>f. facing a significant turning point</p>
<p>Through counselling, our students could get better support in the following
areas:</p>
<p>a. Have a better understanding of the origins and development of emotional
difficulties which enable them to have better control of their feelings
and actions;
<br>b. Develop a more positive attitude towards their self and acknowledge
their strengths and weaknesses;
<br>c. Learn to analyse a problem and develop strategies to work towards a
solution;
<br>d. Learn to acquire social and interpersonal skills such as effective
communication and anger control etc;
<br>e. Identify their personal work values, career interests and preferences
to increase motivation for studies.</p>
