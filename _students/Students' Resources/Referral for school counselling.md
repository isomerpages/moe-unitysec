## Referral for school counselling

#### Objective

School Counselling is an integral part of the Pastoral Care programme in Unity Secondary School. For the development of our students into healthy and effective individuals, their social-emotional development is as crucial as their physical and intellectual developments. 

School Counselling offers support for students who are:

 a.  dealing with the challenges at school or at home<br>
 b.  interested in understanding themselves better<br>
 c.  experiencing relationship difficulties<br>
 d.  feeling depressed or anxious<br>
 e.  experiencing loss or bereavement<br>
 f.  facing a significant turning point

Through counselling, our students could get better support in the following areas:

 a.  Have a better understanding of the origins and development of emotional difficulties which enable them to have better control of their feelings and actions;<br> 
 b.  Develop a more positive attitude towards their self and acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses; <br>
 c.  Learn to analyse a problem and develop strategies to work towards a solution;<br>
 d.  Learn to acquire social and interpersonal skills such as effective communication and anger control etc; <br>
 e.  Identify their personal work values, career interests and preferences to increase motivation for studies.
