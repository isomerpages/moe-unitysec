<p>The mission of the Girls’ Brigade is to develop each girl and officer
to her fullest potential by Equipping, Empowering and Enabling:&nbsp;<em>Every girl a leader, every Officer, a Servant Leader.</em> 
<br>
<br>The Girls’ Brigade in our school which is the&nbsp;<em>19th Girls’ Brigade Company</em>&nbsp;is
a cohesive and closely knitted unit. We received the Silver Honours Roll
for Company Award Competition organized by the Girls’ Brigade Headquarters
in 2019. This award is given based on our active participation and good
teamwork displayed in the annual Girls’ Brigade events such as the GB Friendship
Day and GB Fortnight.
<br>
<br>Interesting programs conducted by the Girls’ Brigade include the annual
camps in March and adventure camp in October, badge work, camp craft and
drills. We have also conducted activities like archery and baking during
our yearly camps. Additionally, the girls will pick up essential knowledge
like total defence and first aid skills.
<br>
<br>On top of learning life skills like leadership, teamwork and effective
communication, the girls in the 19th Company form important and close ties
with one another. It is really their enduring friendships which will see
them through the various challenges that they will face in their leadership
journey ahead.</p>
