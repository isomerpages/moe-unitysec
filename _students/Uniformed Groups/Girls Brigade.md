| The mission of the Girls’ Brigade is to develop each girl and officer to her fullest potential by Equipping, Empowering and Enabling: _Every girl a leader, every Officer, a Servant Leader._  <br><br>The Girls’ Brigade in our school which is the _19th Girls’ Brigade Company_ is a cohesive and closely knitted unit. We received the Silver Honours Roll for Company Award Competition organized by the Girls’ Brigade Headquarters in 2019. This award is given based on our active participation and good teamwork displayed in the annual Girls’ Brigade events such as the GB Friendship Day and GB Fortnight.  <br><br>Interesting programs conducted by the Girls’ Brigade include the annual camps in March and adventure camp in October, badge work, camp craft and drills. We have also conducted activities like archery and baking during our yearly camps. Additionally, the girls will pick up essential knowledge like total defence and first aid skills.  <br><br>On top of learning life skills like leadership, teamwork and effective communication, the girls in the 19th Company form important and close ties with one another. It is really their enduring friendships which will see them through the various challenges that they will face in their leadership journey ahead. |
