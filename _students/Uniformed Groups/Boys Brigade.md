| **CCA Description** |
|:---:|
| The mission of the Boys’ Brigade is to nurture youth, based on Christian values to serve and lead and to be the youth organization of choice.  <br><br>The Boys’ Brigade is a close-knit company. We received the Gold Honours Roll for the&nbsp;_J M Fraser Excellence Award_&nbsp;given by the Boys’ Brigade Headquarters for a consecutive of four years from 2017 to 2020. This award is given based on our active participation and good teamwork displayed in the annual Boys’ Brigade events such as the BB Blaze competition, Values in Action (VIA) programs like the BB CARES and BB Share A Gift.  <br><br>Interesting programs conducted by the Boys’ Brigade include the annual camps in March and October, day camp at Pulau Ubin in June, sport climbing, camp craft and drills. We have also conducted activities like combat skirmish, archery tag and field cooking during our yearly camps. Additionally, the cadets will pick up essential knowledge like first aid and energy conservation.  <br><br>The cadets in the Boys’ Brigade will acquire important life skills like teamwork, discipline and leadership and most of all, they will forge enduring friendships with one another in this CCA. |
