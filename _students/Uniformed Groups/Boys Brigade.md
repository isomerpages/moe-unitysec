<p>The mission of the Boys’ Brigade is to nurture youth, based on Christian
values to serve and lead and to be the youth organization of choice.
<br>
<br>The Boys’ Brigade is a close-knit company. We received the Gold Honours
Roll for the&nbsp;<em>J M Fraser Excellence Award</em>&nbsp;given by the
Boys’ Brigade Headquarters for a consecutive of four years from 2017 to
2020. This award is given based on our active participation and good teamwork
displayed in the annual Boys’ Brigade events such as the BB Blaze competition,
Values in Action (VIA) programs like the BB CARES and BB Share A Gift.
<br>
<br>Interesting programs conducted by the Boys’ Brigade include the annual
camps in March and October, day camp at Pulau Ubin in June, sport climbing,
camp craft and drills. We have also conducted activities like combat skirmish,
archery tag and field cooking during our yearly camps. Additionally, the
cadets will pick up essential knowledge like first aid and energy conservation.
<br>
<br>The cadets in the Boys’ Brigade will acquire important life skills like
teamwork, discipline and leadership and most of all, they will forge enduring
friendships with one another in this CCA.</p>
