<p>Unity Secondary NCC Air Unit aims to develop responsible, resilient and
committed leaders and team players through fun and challenging military
related activities.
<br>
<br>Since the unit was first established, it has performed consistently well
and achieve 11 consecutive Gold Awards (2010 till 2019) and 2 distinctions
in the NCC Best Unit Competition and Unit Recognition (2018 and 2019).
There are various activities and events lined up to cater to the holistic
development of every cadet.
<br>
<br>Being an Air Unit, apart from enriching them with “AIR” syllabus with
aeromodelling programmes like flying drones and simulators, our cadets
also get to engage in different fun sports such as soccer and laser tag
while at the same time forging team spirit and camaraderie between themselves.
All cadets are given every opportunity to assume leadership positions.
<br>
<br>With growing support from the RSAF and NCC HQ, we will continue to seek
new avenues to enrich the NCC Air experience of our cadets and provide
more opportunities and exposure to hone our cadets’ leadership.</p>
