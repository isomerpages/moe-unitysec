| The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC), a Uniform group, has been around for over 50 years. In Unity, we train our cadets to be disciplined and also to develop a sense of belonging to NPCC. We strive to work hard and improve ourselves for the better.  <br><br>For the latest updates on our programme, do check us out at our micro-site below:  <br>[Unity Secondary NPCC Website](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/ussnpcc/) |
