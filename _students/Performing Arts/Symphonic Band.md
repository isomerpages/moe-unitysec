| **CCA Description** |
|:---:|
| Under the baton of experienced conductors, Mr Takehiro Oura and Mr Wilson Ong, Unity Secondary Symphonic Band aims to provide our Band members the opportunity to learn more about music and their instruments and develop them to be a performer to work together with other members to create beautiful music. In the process, we hope to develop them into respectful, responsible and disciplined individuals who are adaptable and aims for high standards in everything they do.  <br><br>Through the programs planned for every year, Band members have the opportunity to hone their skills through school and public performances, for example the yearly Chinese New Year community performance at Yew Tee Square as part of their VIA, the schoolâ€™s Awards Night and National Day Celebration, as well as the biannual Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, where our students achieved Certificate of Accomplishment in 2017 and 2019.  <br><br>Our band members also have the opportunity to interact with band members from other schools through Adventure Band Camp (for Sec 1) and WBAS Band Festival (Sec 2 and 3). Our Sec 3 student leaders also have the opportunity to interact and learn from veteran band instructors and band leaders from other schools through the WBAS Youth Band Leaders Conference. |
