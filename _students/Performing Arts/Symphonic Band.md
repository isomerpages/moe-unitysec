<p>Under the baton of experienced conductors, Mr Takehiro Oura and Mr Wilson
Ong, Unity Secondary Symphonic Band aims to provide our Band members the
opportunity to learn more about music and their instruments and develop
them to be a performer to work together with other members to create beautiful
music. In the process, we hope to develop them into respectful, responsible
and disciplined individuals who are adaptable and aims for high standards
in everything they do.
<br>
<br>Through the programs planned for every year, Band members have the opportunity
to hone their skills through school and public performances, for example
the yearly Chinese New Year community performance at Yew Tee Square as
part of their VIA, the schoolâ€™s Awards Night and National Day Celebration,
as well as the biannual Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation,
where our students achieved Certificate of Accomplishment in 2017 and 2019.
<br>
<br>Our band members also have the opportunity to interact with band members
from other schools through Adventure Band Camp (for Sec 1) and WBAS Band
Festival (Sec 2 and 3). Our Sec 3 student leaders also have the opportunity
to interact and learn from veteran band instructors and band leaders from
other schools through the WBAS Youth Band Leaders Conference.</p>
