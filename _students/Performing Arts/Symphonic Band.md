<p>Under the baton of our experienced conductor, Mr Wilson Ong, the Unity
Secondary Symphonic Band aims to nurture our members’ passion for music
and their instruments. Guided by our motto, “One Heart, One Sound, One
Band,” we believe in the power of unity and teamwork in creating meaningful
music together. Through a comprehensive band programme, students develop
musical skills, teamwork, and performance confidence while learning to
create music harmoniously. Beyond musicianship, we strive to mould our
members into respectful, responsible, and disciplined individuals who are
adaptable and committed to excellence in all that they do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each year, our band members hone their performance skills through a variety
of school and public performances, such as the annual Chinese New Year
performance by Yew Tee CC, the school’s Awards Night, and National Day
Celebrations. The band also participates in the Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) Arts Presentation biennially, achieving the Certificate of Distinction
in both 2023 and 2025.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our students also benefit from opportunities to collaborate and learn
with peers from other schools through platforms such as the Wind Bands
Association of Singapore (WBAS) Band Festival for Secondary 2 and 3 members
and various school band exchanges. In addition, our Secondary 3 student
leaders attend the WBAS Youth Band Leaders Conference, where they learn
from veteran instructors and student leaders across Singapore. Through
these enriching experiences, the Unity Secondary Symphonic Band continues
to inspire a lifelong love for music while instilling values that extend
far beyond the band room.</p>
