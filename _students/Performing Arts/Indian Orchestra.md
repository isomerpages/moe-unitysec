| Indian Orchestra CCA's core mission is to cultivate love for orchestra music among its members, so that they will enjoy playing the instruments. Since we are the only secondary school which has Indian Orchestra CCA in Singapore, we want to develop among our CCA members an enjoyment and appreciation of Indian classical instruments, an awareness of Indian culture and a sense of belonging to the CCA. |
