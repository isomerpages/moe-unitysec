| **CCA Description** |
|:---:|
| The Unity Secondary School Choir, also known as _UniqVoices_, is a youth choir consisting of vibrant and enthusiastic choristers who work hard, have fun, and share a common love in singing. We strive to inculcate a passion for singing in each of our students, and we welcome anybody who wants to learn to sing into our _UniqVoices_ family. Besides singing, we also seek to nurture our choristers into confident and gracious student leaders.  <br><br>Since its inception, _UniqVoices_ has consistently received accolades at the Singapore Youth Festival and was conferred the prestigious Certificate of Distinction for nearly two decades.  <br><br>_UniqVoices_’ repertoire ranges from classical to contemporary, singing in English, Latin, Malay, Chinese, Tamil as well as Japanese songs. Through exposure to public and prominent national events such as the Singapore National Day Parade (2018) and Voices of Singapore concert at CHIJMES (2018, 2019), _UniqVoices_ also hopes to contribute to a lifelong appreciation of the vocal music in the community.  <br><br>To ensure the continued excellence of our chorale programme, our young singers are regularly coached by renowned international choral conductors and clinicians. This gives them the exposure they need to grow and develop in their talents.  <br><br>It is our long-standing belief that through providing a nurturing environment, guidance and opportunities for students who love music, they would develop their individual talents, and they would also be imbued with our school’s values of respect, integrity and perseverance. |
