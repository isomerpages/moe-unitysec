| The _USS Up:OnStage_ is a vibrant and tightly-knit club that aims to inculcate the love for the dramatic arts in its members through creative and impactful stage productions. Our members work together towards a common goal of attaining excellence and in the process, stronger bonds are forged as they strive to overcome various challenges as a family.  <br><br>We teach our students a variety of acting, direction and stage management skills as well as practical techniques such as voice projection and body movements that will help them evolve into confident speakers in future.  <br><br>Every year, our members put up performances for school events such as Awards Day, Teachers Day celebrations and USS Open House and serve the community through meaningful Values-In-Action activities. |
