<p><strong>Drama CCA</strong> is a vibrant and tightly-knit community that
seeks to inculcate a deep appreciation for the dramatic arts through creative
and impactful stage productions. United by a shared pursuit of excellence,
our members collaborate closely, forging strong bonds as they overcome
challenges together and grow as one supportive family.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through structured training, students are equipped with a wide range of
skills in <strong>acting, directing, and stage management</strong>, alongside
essential performance techniques such as <strong>voice projection, articulation, movement, and stage presence</strong>.
These experiences nurture confidence, resilience, and effective communication
skills that extend beyond the stage and into their everyday lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our commitment to artistic excellence is affirmed through our performance
at the <strong>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)</strong>, where the Drama
CCA attained Accomplishment, reflecting the dedication, discipline, and
creative growth of our students.</p>
<p>Beyond SYF, Drama CCA members actively contribute to school life by staging
performances for key events such as <strong>Awards Day, National Day Celebrations, and Open House</strong>,
while also giving back to the community through meaningful <strong>Values-In-Action (VIA)</strong> initiatives.
Through these varied experiences, students develop not only as performers,
but also as empathetic individuals and responsible leaders.</p>
