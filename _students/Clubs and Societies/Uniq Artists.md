<br>The Unity Secondary School Art Club is a newly-formed CCA in 2021. Our
art club, known as&nbsp;<strong><em>Uniq.Artists</em></strong>, is represented
by the logo with the letters&nbsp;U&nbsp;and&nbsp;A. The A is on top of
the U because the artist is the core of the CCA. The&nbsp;U&nbsp;and&nbsp;A&nbsp;are
joined into an oval shape to symbolise the infinity journey of art-learning
and art-making. Finally, the red dot that differentiates the A from the
U symbolises us as artists belonging to the precious little red dot, Singapore.
<br>
<br>We aim to bring together like-minded people once or twice a week to experiment
with different mediums to create creative art works, to learn how to appreciate
art works and to contribute to the school and/or larger community with
our creations. Members will also have the opportunity to learn from professional
artists and contribute to the community with our creativity. We will also
learn to curate our own art works and prepare for art exhibitions.</p>
