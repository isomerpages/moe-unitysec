| **CCA Description** |
|:---:|
| **Unique Media Productions (UMP)** comprises two somewhat distinct service groups that are united by their traditions of conscientious duty and their unflagging commitment to serving the school in technical arenas, namely the media club, Unique Productions, and the Public Address Crew.  <br><br>Under UMP, Unitians develop not only their skills and confidence in the handling of audio and/or visual equipment, but also their personal efficacies, including their problem-solving abilities, adaptive resourcefulness and overall creativity.  <br><br>**UMP (Audio)** establishes and maintains the optimal soundscapes (sound levels and outputs) of each school event, be they daily assemblies or instances of school wide celebration; and is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the physical sound hardware that make these possible.  <br><br>**UMP (Photography)** develops creativity, imagination and confidence as well as a sense of perspective, composition and an eye for detail in order to capture the fleeting moments of meaning and significance within the fluid dynamism of school events and celebrations.  <br><br>**UMP (Videography)** hones their technical skills and creative perspectives in the areas of videography which find expression in their capturing and documentation of each of Unity’s significant moments in memorable video footage.  <br><br>Under the capable guidance of our trainers, UMP members acquire skills and insights into Videography and Photography. With these they will participate in various national competitions, including the annual Central Narcotics Bureau Drugfree SG Competition, Our School, Our Stories Photo Essay Contest and Singapore Young Photographers Convention. |
