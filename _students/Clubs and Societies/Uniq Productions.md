<p><strong>Unique Media Productions (UMP)</strong>&nbsp;comprises two somewhat
distinct service groups that are united by their traditions of conscientious
duty and their unflagging commitment to serving the school in technical
arenas, namely the media club, Unique Productions, and the Public Address
Crew.
<br>
<br>Under UMP, Unitians develop not only their skills and confidence in the
handling of audio and/or visual equipment, but also their personal efficacies,
including their problem-solving abilities, adaptive resourcefulness and
overall creativity.
<br>
<br><strong>UMP (Audio)</strong>&nbsp;establishes and maintains the optimal
soundscapes (sound levels and outputs) of each school event, be they daily
assemblies or instances of school wide celebration; and is responsible
for ensuring the integrity of the physical sound hardware that make these
possible.
<br>
<br><strong>UMP (Photography)</strong>&nbsp;develops creativity, imagination
and confidence as well as a sense of perspective, composition and an eye
for detail in order to capture the fleeting moments of meaning and significance
within the fluid dynamism of school events and celebrations.
<br>
<br><strong>UMP (Videography)</strong>&nbsp;hones their technical skills and
creative perspectives in the areas of videography which find expression
in their capturing and documentation of each of Unity’s significant moments
in memorable video footage.
<br>
<br>Under the capable guidance of our trainers, UMP members acquire skills
and insights into Videography and Photography. With these they will participate
in various national competitions, including the annual Central Narcotics
Bureau Drugfree SG Competition, Our School, Our Stories Photo Essay Contest
and Singapore Young Photographers Convention.</p>
