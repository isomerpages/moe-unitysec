| _Our pledge:_  <br><br>We, the members of Unique Ecologists, pledge ourselves to be environmentally friendly, to be committed in protecting the environment with pride and confidence and to promote awareness about the environment to family and friends as well as to the public.  <br><br>The Uniq Ecologists’ pledge was created by the first batch of members in 2018. The members also decided to name the CCA, essentially the environment club, ‘Uniq Ecologists’.  <br><br>In line with our pledge, the members have been actively engaging the public to reuse paper and to use fewer plastic bags. Note books were made from reusable paper and free non-plastic bags were collected, then given out to members of the public. We have also tied up with North West CDC to encourage members of the public to reduce waste in the areas of water, electricity and food. Members went door-knocking to spread this important message. Members join in Yew Tee Day activities, including the collection of recyclables.  <br><br>To commemorate Earth Day, CCA members speak to the school at morning assembly about environmental issues. They also prepare static displays to further educate the school population about the challenges faced by the environment and to inspire students to take positive actions for change. |
