## Applied Learning Programme (ALP)

#### Applied Learning Programme (ALP) â€“ Biotechnology in Food Sustainability

The ALP programme enriches our students with skills of Biotechnology to relate to real world problems of food sustainability especially in the context of Singapore. Our students learn basic Microscopy, Microbiology, Plant Tissue Culture, Food Waste Composting and Hydroponics. Some of our students are also exposed to higher level research with these skills acquired. The scope of knowledge is far beyond their normal science lessons and with much hands on experiential learning, the students enjoy the exciting lessons donning on lab coats with the feeling of being a young scientist.
