#### Aesthetics Education

As spelt out by the MOE Arts Education Branch, the role of arts education is central in developing our children a lively curiosity and an inquisitive mind. This is essential as it promotes inventive thinking and an innovative orientation in what they do. Arts education is also the gateway to our children’s sense of aesthetics, which is the basis of how they perceive the world at large and all that is around them. Such a perspective helps them make meaning of their lives, culture and identity.

In Unity, we have aligned our arts education programme with that of MOE as well as the school’s Holistic Student Development Framework and Leadership Learning Framework, giving rise to the Aesthetics Education Framework.
