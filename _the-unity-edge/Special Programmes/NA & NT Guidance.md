## NA/NT Guidance

The goals of the NA/NT Guidance Committee are:

*   to engage NA/NT students in programmes which can help to achieve the desired outcomes of education, namely, to become a
    *   confident person
    *   self-directed learner
    *   active contributor
    *   concerned citizen
  
*   to understand students’ needs and provide effective care and guidance, so that they will have self-awareness, a sound moral compass, and the necessary skills and knowledge to take on future challenges

Some of the programmes conducted for NA/NT students are as follows:

*   Elective Modules
*   Advanced Elective Modules
*   Youth Apprenticeship Programme
*   Local and Overseas Learning Journeys
*   Work Experience in Post-Secondary Educational Institutions
*   Work Attachments in Local Industries

The committee also plays a critical role in preparing students for the working world, by equipping them with the basic skills to remain competitive in the global economy, and lead meaningful and productive lives.
