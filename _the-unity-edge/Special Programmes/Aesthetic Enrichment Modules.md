<h2>Aesthetic Enrichment Modules</h2>
<p>Aligned with Aesthetics Education Committee's vision of developing students
to be confident, creative and resilient persons through the Exposure, Enrichment
and Experience approach, the Sec 1 Aesthetics Enrichment Modules were conducted
during curriculum time in Semester 1, where all Sec 1 students could choose
to learn to either play the guitar, dance or sing over 12 one-hour lessons.</p>
<p>This culminated in the Sec 1 AEM Showcase, where each of the 5 guitar,
3 dance and 2 pop vocal groups applied what they had learnt in AEM by performing
an item together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from staff and students, more than 100 parents also came to support
their children and see for themselves what they had learnt.</p>
