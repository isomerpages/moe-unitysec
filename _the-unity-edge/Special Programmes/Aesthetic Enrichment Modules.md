## Aesthetic Enrichment Modules

Aligned with Aesthetics Education Committee's vision of developing students to be confident, creative and resilient persons through the Exposure, Enrichment and Experience approach, the Sec 1 Aesthetics Enrichment Modules were conducted during curriculum time in Semester 1, where all Sec 1 students could choose to learn to either play the guitar, dance or sing over 12 one-hour lessons.

This culminated in the Sec 1 AEM Showcase, where each of the 5 guitar, 3 dance and 2 pop vocal groups applied what they had learnt in AEM by performing an item together.Â 

Apart from staff and students, more than 100 parents also came to support their children and see for themselves what they had learnt.
