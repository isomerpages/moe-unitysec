## Twinning Program

Unity Secondary School was given the opportunity to host Ramadevi Public School from Hyderabad from 12 to 19 August. Hosting of overseas students is part of Unity’s Internationalisation Programme which aims to nurture culturally confident and knowledgeable Unitians who enjoy cross cultural interactions.

During the eight days of hosting, our students were exposed to the different aspects of Indian culture as well as a glimpse of India’s rich history. Similarly, students from Ramadevi were given the opportunity to understand Singapore’s diverse culture through the interactions they had with Unitians, the student leaders as well as Unity teachers.

As part of their immersion programme, Ramadevi students participated in the Maths, Science, Humanities, DT and FCE lessons. They also had the chance to try out a few CCAs to understand our Singapore school system. Our India guests also went for a few learning journeys around Singapore to understand about the country’s development over the years.

The Hosting programme was a wonderful experience that strengthened the friendship between the two schools and we look forward for more cultural exchanges in the future.
