<h2>International Immersion Programme</h2>
<p>Through the immersion program, students experience new cultures and develop
new understanding of their place in the world. They are given the opportunity
to be ambassadors of the school and at the same time develop self- resilience.&nbsp;
<br>With the emphasis on developing 21st Century Competencies (21CC), the
school aims to develop Unitian’s global awareness and cross-cultural skills.
Overseas learning journeys are powerful learning experiences for the students
to reflect and deepen their commitment and rootedness to Singapore. Visits
from overseas schools offer opportunities for cultural exchange as they
learn about each other's cultures, traditions, customs, and ways of life.</p>
<p><strong>Through the International Immersion Programme, Unitians will:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>1） Develop 21st Century Competencies of Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural
skills and sensitivities</p>
<p>2）Develop Communication and Collaboration skills as well as Critical Thinking
in understanding the development of visiting countries and Singapore</p>
<p>3）Strengthen their Commitment and Rootedness to Singapore</p>
