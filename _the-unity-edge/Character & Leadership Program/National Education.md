## National Education

#### National Education (NE) framework

Our Unity’s National Education (NE) framework is guided by the Six NE Messages and is symbolized by the image of a house to help the students to remember that Singapore will always be their home and that they should stay rooted to our country. NE in Unity is anchored on the school core values, and underpinned by the principles of the 3Hs – Head, Heart & Hands. Through NE in the school, every student can be developed as a Unitian with a sense of national pride, who embrace diversity and who have the commitment to serve the nation with civic responsibility.

##### <u>Themes for NE Core Events</u>

The school has its own NE themes aligned to the Leadership Learning framework which guide the commemoration for each of the four NE core events:

| **International Friendship Day:**<br>Respect Differences, Build Bonds with Other Nations |
| **Racial Harmony Day:**<br>Serve Others with Compassion, Respect All as One People |

**<u>NE Learning Journeys</u>**

NE learning journeys which are aligned to the specific CLD level outcomes are also planned for the students. These learning journeys include:

1.      ‘Gems of Katong’ trail (Self) for the Secondary 1 students,

2.      Kranji Heritages (Community) for the Secondary 2 students, and

3.      Learning journey to Singapore Discovery Centre (Nation) for the Secondary 3 students.

Through National Education, we aim to instil a sense of pride and nationalism in the students and develop them into leaders of self and leaders of others.
