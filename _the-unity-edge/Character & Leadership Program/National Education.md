<h2>National Education</h2>
<h4>National Education (NE) framework</h4>
<p>In Unity, the National Education (NE) programme is guided by the principle
of “We don’t learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on experiences.”
As such, lesson experiences are designed to engage students to reflect
on real life experience and to provide opportunities and experiences for
them to interact with diverse socio-cultural groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through our NE programme, every Unitian can be developed to be Concerned
Citizen, one who has the key dispositions of a Sense of Belonging, a Sense
of Reality, a Sense of Hope and the Will to Act:</p>
