## National Education

#### National Education (NE) framework

Our Unity’s National Education (NE) framework is guided by the Six NE Messages and is symbolized by the image of a house to help the students to remember that Singapore will always be their home and that they should stay rooted to our country. NE in Unity is anchored on the school core values, and underpinned by the principles of the 3Hs – Head, Heart & Hands. Through NE in the school, every student can be developed as a Unitian with a sense of national pride, who embrace diversity and who have the commitment to serve the nation with civic responsibility.
