<h2>Values in Action</h2>
<p>In Unity Secondary School, Values in Action (VIA) is a platform where
students demonstrate their understanding of the various contemporary issue
themes such as environment and active citizenship. All students will get
an opportunity to apply what they have learnt in the classroom in the real-world
context, demonstrating and appreciating values such as empathy when they
plan and execute their VIA projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>To this end, we adopt an Active Learning approach in structuring Design
Thinking into our CCE-VIA lessons. Design Thinking is used as a framework
to compare and question perspectives of an issue at hand. This helps students
to make sense of what they have learnt during the contemporary issue lessons,
where they get to examine a pertinent social issue from the local and global
perspective.&nbsp;With this, students think and discuss about the needs
and challenges of different groups of people in the community. They brainstorm
for ideas with the intention to help them and to make an impact, learning
to think from the perspective of others.&nbsp;</p>
