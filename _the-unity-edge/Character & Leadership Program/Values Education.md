<h3>VALUES IN EDUCATION 2024</h3>
<p>Values education is important for our secondary school students because
it helps them develop good character, make ethical decisions, build positive
relationships, understand their roles in society, stay resilient, and prepare
for adulthood.</p>

Leadership Challenge Model (LCM) are affirmed through our school Catch,
Highlight and Multiply platform.</p>
