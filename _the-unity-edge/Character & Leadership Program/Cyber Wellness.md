## Cyber Wellness

With the increased connectivity and the exposure in cyber space, a Cyber Wellness programme is necessary to help our students to be discerning prosumers (both producers and consumers) in this space.

The Cyber Wellness programme in the school is guided by MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework which is underpinned by the principles of “Respect for Self and Others” and “Safe and Responsible Use" and the 3-step process of Sense, Think and Act.

This 3-step process serves to highlight the stages that our students should go through to prepare himself/ herself to self-manage in cyberspace.

The Cyber Wellness programme serves to help our students be aware of the risks of harmful online behaviours, and the means to protect themselves from such behaviours. It seeks to empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace.

Cyber Wellness lesson resources adapted from MOE as well as in-house video clips are used to guide students to take responsibility for their own well-being in cyberspace. The topics to be covered under the school’s Cyber Wellness programme include:<br>
