<h2>Cyber Wellness</h2>
<p>In today's digital age, where connectivity and exposure in cyberspace
are ever-increasing, fostering a Cyber Wellness programme becomes imperative.
At Unity Secondary School, we recognize the importance of equipping our
students to navigate the digital landscape as discerning prosumers—both
producers and consumers—with responsibility and awareness.</p>
<p>Aligned with the Ministry of Education's (MOE) Cyber Wellness Framework,
our programme is rooted in the principles of "Respect for Self and Others"
and "Safe and Responsible Use." Guided by a structured 3-step process—Sense,
Think, Act—we empower our students to effectively self-manage in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Our Cyber Wellness programme is designed to raise awareness about the
risks associated with harmful online behaviours while providing students
with the tools to protect themselves. Through a combination of MOE-adapted
resources, we engage students in topics covered under the school’s Cyber
Wellness programme which include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Balanced Use of ICT&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About the Cyber World&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling Online Content and Behaviour&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online Identity and Expression&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online Relationships&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyber Bullying&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Netiquette&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyber Contacts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a collaborative effort with the Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore,
our school proudly introduces the "Be Cybersafe" pop-up box—a dynamic learning
environment featuring interactive digital panels and a gaming vending machine.
Here, students not only learn about cybersecurity but also put their knowledge
to the test through engaging games, reinforcing essential lessons while
having fun and winning prizes.</p>
<p>From assembly programme delivering crucial cyber hygiene tips to hands-on
experiences at the "Be Cybersafe" pop-up box, Unitians are equipped with
the necessary skills and habits for responsible digital citizenship. By
nurturing a culture of awareness and responsibility, we continue to uphold
Cyber Wellness as an integral part of our educational ethos, ensuring a
safe and empowering digital environment for all Unitians.</p>
