<h5>Direct School Admission (DSA)<br>Actualising Sportsmanship Through Basketball Programme</h5>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE's move
towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec
Exercise, participating secondary schools will be able to select a percentage
of their students for admission outside of the centralised posting system,
via their own selection criteria. These criteria can include diverse academic
and non-academic achievements and talents.</p>
<p>With the tweak in the DSA-Sec-Exercise for 2018 whereby all schools can
offer up to 20% of the Secondary One places to students, Unity Secondary
School, with the years of experience, is well-equipped with the expertise
to maximise the potential of this larger pool of talent.</p>
<h4>School Vision&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Our vision is to nurture students to Lifelong Learners, Inspiring Leaders.
We believe that sports provide a platform to equip our students with the
values of Respect, Compassion, Commitment, Integrity and Perseverance to
develop the child leadership qualities.</p>
<h4>Achievements</h4>
<p>The tables below summarises our basketball achievements which affirms
the effective structures and processes that we have put in place within
the programme despite our school’s short history.</p>
