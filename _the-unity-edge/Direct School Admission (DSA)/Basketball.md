##### <center>Direct School Admission (DSA)<br>Actualising Sportsmanship Through Basketball Programme</center>

#### Background

The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE's move towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec Exercise, participating secondary schools will be able to select a percentage of their students for admission outside of the centralised posting system, via their own selection criteria. These criteria can include diverse academic and non-academic achievements and talents.

In April 2009, MOE approved Unity Secondary School as one of the schools under the DSA-Sec Exercise for niche development in Basketball. From 2010 - 2017, Unity Secondary School had been offering up to 5% of the Secondary One places to students with talent in basketball, to build on our niche area in basketball.

With the tweak in the DSA-Sec-Exercise for 2018 whereby all schools can offer up to 20% of the Secondary One places to students, Unity Secondary School, with the years of experience, is well-equipped with the expertise to maximise the potential of this larger pool of talent.

#### School Vision 

Our vision is to nurture students to Lifelong Learners, Inspiring Leaders. We believe that sports provide a platform to equip our students with the values of Respect, Compassion, Commitment, Integrity and Perseverance to develop the child leadership qualities.

#### Achievements

The tables below summarises our basketball achievements which affirms the effective structures and processes that we have put in place within the programme despite our school’s short history.

Over the past few years, Unity has produced many outstanding players who went on to represent Singapore Schools as well as Singapore at youth, national and professional levels. Unity Secondary School provides a **conducive environment for our players to develop character and to achieve excellence.**

#### Programme 

Unity Secondary School has a comprehensive development programme to groom our basketballers into outstanding players.  Besides building the essential skills and knowledge, the programme is structured to provide players with a range of experiences that go beyond just playing of the game. These include

*   Umpiring matches
*   Organising intra- and inter-school tournaments
*   Coaching junior players
*   Mental Strength Training
*   Overseas Training Tours

We have a team of passionate, committed and experienced teachers and coaches who oversee the physical, social and emotional well-being as well as the **academic progress** of the players.
