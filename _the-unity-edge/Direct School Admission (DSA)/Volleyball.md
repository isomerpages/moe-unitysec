##### <center>Direct School Admission (DSA)<br>Actualising Sportsmanship Through Volleyball Programme</center>

#### Our Background

The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE's move towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec Exercise, participating secondary schools will be able to select a percentage of their students for admission outside of the centralised posting system, via their own selection criteria. These criteria can include diverse academic and non-academic achievements and talents.  

With the tweak in the DSA-Sec-Exercise for 2018 whereby all schools can offer up to 20% of the Secondary One places to students, Unity Secondary School, with the years of experience, is well-equipped with the expertise to maximise the potential of this larger pool of talent.

#### Our School Vision

Our vision is to nurture students to Lifelong Learners, Inspiring Leaders. We believe that sports provide a platform to equip our students with the values of Respect, Compassion, Commitment, Integrity and Perseverance to develop the child leadership qualities.
