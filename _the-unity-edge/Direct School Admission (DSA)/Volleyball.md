##### <center>Direct School Admission (DSA)<br>Actualising Sportsmanship Through Volleyball Programme</center>

#### Our Background

The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE's move towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec Exercise, participating secondary schools will be able to select a percentage of their students for admission outside of the centralised posting system, via their own selection criteria. These criteria can include diverse academic and non-academic achievements and talents.  

Starting in 2018, Unity Secondary School decided to offer Direct School Admission (DSA) for students who are talented in Volleyball, together with the current Basketball scheme which started in 2010. In total, the school is allowed to take up to 20% of the school Secondary One population through DSA.

#### Our School Vision

Our vision is to nurture students to Lifelong Learners, Inspiring Leaders. We believe that sports provide a platform to equip our students with the values of Respect, Compassion, Commitment, Integrity and Perseverance to develop the child leadership qualities.

#### Our Volleyball

Our Volleyball Girls CCA programme undergoes a restructure in 2013 after many years of mediocre results in the National Schools Games. As the school does not have DSA programme for Volleyball since the start of the CCA, most of the students who joined the CCA, started playing the game only in Unity Secondary. With zero volleyball background, the girls trained really hard to improve on their fundamentals so they can do well in the National Schools Games. With the restructure of our programme and a little more hard work by the girls, the Volleyball Girls began to show some results in the B Division from 2014 and they achieved Top 4 placing in the C Division for 3 consecutive years from 2015 to 2017. The tables below summarises the teams achievements which affirms the effective structures and processes that we have put in place within the programme despite our school’s short history.
