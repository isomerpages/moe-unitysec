<h1>Direct School Admission (DSA) 2025</h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3>Actualising Sportsmanship Through Volleyball Programme</h3>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE’s move
towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec
Exercise, participating secondary schools will be able to select a percentage
of their students for admission outside of the centralised posting system,
via their own selection criteria. These criteria can include diverse academic
and non-academic achievements and talents.</p>
<p>With the tweak in the DSA-Sec-Exercise for 2018 whereby all schools can
offer up to 20% of the Secondary One places to students, Unity Secondary
School, with the years of experience, is well-equipped with the expertise
to maximise the potential of this larger pool of talent.</p>
<h3>School Vision</h3>
<p>Our vision is to nurture students to Lifelong Learners, Inspiring Leaders.
We believe that sports provide a platform to equip our students with the
values of Respect, Compassion, Commitment, Integrity and Perseverance to
develop the child's leadership qualities.</p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>The table below summarises our basketball achievements which affirms the
effective structures and processes that we have put in place within the
programme despite our school’s short history.</p>
