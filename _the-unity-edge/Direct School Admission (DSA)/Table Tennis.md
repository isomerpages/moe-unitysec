<h2>Table Tennis</h2>
<h5>Direct School Admission (DSA)<br>Actualising Sportsmanship Through Table Tennis Programme</h5>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE's move
towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec
Exercise, participating secondary schools will be able to select a percentage
of their students for admission outside of the centralised posting system,
through their own selection criteria. These criteria can include diverse
academic and non-academic achievements and talents.</p>
<p>Unity Secondary School will be offering up to 20% of the Secondary One
places to students with talent in table tennis, to build on our niche area
in table tennis.</p>
<h4>School Vision&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Our vision is to nurture students to Lifelong Learners, Inspiring Leaders.
We believe that sports provide a platform to equip our students with the
values of Respect, Compassion, Commitment, Integrity and Perseverance to
develop the child leadership qualities.</p>
