##### <center>Direct School Admission (DSA)<br>Actualising Sportsmanship Through Table Tennis Programme</center>

#### Background

The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE's move towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec Exercise, participating secondary schools will be able to select a percentage of their students for admission outside of the centralised posting system, through their own selection criteria. These criteria can include diverse academic and non-academic achievements and talents.

Unity Secondary School will be offering up to 20% of the Secondary One places to students with talent in table tennis, to build on our niche area in table tennis. 

#### School Vision&nbsp;

Our vision is to nurture students to Lifelong Learners, Inspiring Leaders. We believe that sports provide a platform to equip our students with the values of Respect, Compassion, Commitment, Integrity and Perseverance to develop the child leadership qualities.

#### Achievements - National School Games

-	Consistent improvement in performance for B Division Girls in National School Games (NSG)
-	Unity Secondary Schoolâ€™s Table Tennis CCA provides a conducive environment for our players to develop character and to achieve excellence.

#### Programme&nbsp;

Unity Secondary School provides ample opportunities and a comprehensive development programme to groom our table tennis players into outstanding players.  Besides building the essential skills and knowledge, the programme is structured to provide players with a range of experiences that go beyond just playing of the game. These include:

* Video recording matches for reflective learning (using learning journals)
* Organising internal &amp; friendly competitions with other schools
* Mentoring junior players

We have a team of passionate, committed and experienced teachers and coaches who oversee the physical, social and emotional well-being as well as the **academic progress** of the players.
