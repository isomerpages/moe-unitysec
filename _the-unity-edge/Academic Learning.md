## Subjects Offered

#### Overview

##### Course of Study

Starting from the 2024 Secondary 1 cohort, the Normal (Technical), Normal (Academic) and Express streams will be removed. Under Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB), students will be posted through Posting Groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively instead and have greater flexibility to offer subjects at different subject levels as they progress through secondary school.
