<h2>Subjects Offered</h2>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<h5>Course of Study</h5>
<p>Starting from the 2024 Secondary 1 cohort, the Normal (Technical), Normal
(Academic) and Express streams will be removed. Under Full Subject-Based
Banding (Full SBB), students will be posted through Posting Groups 1, 2
and 3 respectively instead and have greater flexibility to offer subjects
at different subject levels as they progress through secondary school.</p>
