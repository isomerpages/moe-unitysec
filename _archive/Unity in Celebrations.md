#### Unity Virtual Run 2021

The school is organizing a virtual running event,&nbsp;_Unity Virtual Run 2021_, during the March Term Break. This event serves as an avenue for Unitians to experience the annual Unity Run safely amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. It also aims to promote the importance of leading a healthy and active lifestyle.  
  
The event would run from&nbsp;**13 March to 21 March**&nbsp;inclusively and it would involve students utilizing a running app,&nbsp;_Strava_, to&nbsp;track their own runs outside of school during the term break.&nbsp;With their run details, students will submit the information via a Google Form for collation.  
  
Please find below the&nbsp;**safety measures**&nbsp;put in place for the event:  
  
1 \. &nbsp;&nbsp;Students who are medically exempted from physical activities are excused from the event.  
2 \. &nbsp;&nbsp;Each student is limited to 3 submissions with a maximum activity duration of 15 minutes. This is to prevent students from overexerting themselves.  
3 \. &nbsp;&nbsp;Students have been instructed to warm up sufficiently and hydrate adequately prior to their physical activity.  
4 \. &nbsp;&nbsp;Students have been advised to not engage in outdoor activities between 10.30am to 3.30pm.  
5 \. &nbsp;&nbsp;Students are advised to run on the pavements, park connectors, in the stadiums or around the school field (during its opening hours). Running on the roads is strictly prohibited.  
  
Thank you.
