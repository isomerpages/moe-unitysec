<br><strong>Can my child qualify for Unity Secondary if his/her score is below the cut off score by 1 or 2 marks?</strong>
</p>
<p>Admission is based on both merit and choice. While your child may still
indicate Unity Secondary as their first or second choice, it is important
to note that placement is not guaranteed if their score falls below the
previous year's Cut-Off Point (COP). The COP can vary slightly each year
(usually by about 1–2 points) depending on the cohort’s performance and
overall demand.</p>
<p>We encourage students to use the previous year’s COP as a guide, and to
ensure that the rest of their school choices are within their Achievement
Level range to maximise their chances of successful placement.</p>
<p><strong>Does putting the school as first choice give me higher priority?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, it does, provided your child’s score is within our cut-off range
and vacancies have not been filled by students having higher scores than
your child who have put Unity as their first choice.</p>
<h3>School Structures</h3>
<p><strong>1. How many Sec 1 classes do we have in 2025?</strong>
</p>
<p>We have 8 classes of Sec 1 students.</p>
<p><strong>2. How is the form class structure in Unity Sec?</strong>
</p>
<p>We have a CCA mixed form class where we have 2 CCAs forming a form class.
Students will learn the common curriculum subjects in their CCA mixed form
class. Common Curriculum subjects include PE, DT, FCE, Art and Music.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3. How did the school perform in National Examinations?</strong>
</p>
<p>The school has maintained a strong performance in the national examinations.
Each year, more than 95% of our Express stream students qualify for admission
to Polytechnics, and at least 70% qualify for Junior Colleges. Among our
Normal (Academic) students, at least 80% are eligible to progress to Secondary
5 to pursue the GCE O-Level examinations.</p>
<h3>Academic</h3>
<p><strong>1. Does the school offer a ‘Triple Science’ Combination?</strong>
</p>
<p>The school does not offer a Triple Science Combination. The offer of subjects
for Upper Secondary is aligned to criteria for admissions to post-secondary
courses in JCs and Polytechnics.</p>
<p><strong>2. Does the school offer Double Science (Pure Physics &amp; Pure Chemistry) with POA?</strong>
</p>
<p>No, the school does not offer such subject combinations. To ensure that
our students qualify for post-secondary admissions to JCs or Polytechnics,
the school ensures that students have the necessary Science, Mathematics,
Humanities, and Elective combinations. POA is not a key requirement for
Business and Finance courses at Polytechnics.</p>
<p><strong>3. What is the criteria for taking Additional Mathematics in Secondary 3?</strong>
</p>
<p>A strong foundation in Lower Secondary Mathematics is important for taking
Additional Mathematics at Upper Secondary. Students who are interested
in Additional Mathematics but are still strengthening their foundation
may consider G2 Additional Mathematics, which is less demanding. For students
aiming for Junior College admission, please note that a minimum of five
G3 subjects is required. For more information on post-secondary pathways,
please refer to the chart below.</p>

test the students on their suitability for the Dance CCA.
<br><em>Football:</em> Selection trials will be conducted during CCA Open House
to assess their skills and suitability for Football CCA.
<br><em>Volleyball:</em> Selection exercise for application through DSA.</p>
<p>
<br>Even though we have DSA volleyball students, most of the volleyball team
are selected through the volleyball trial during the CCA Open House and
CCA experience.</p>
<p><strong>3. What are the chances of getting into Uniformed Group (UG) CCA if the students choose it as their first choice?</strong>
</p>
<p>All students will be given priority to go into UG CCA if they put it as
their first choice. Therefore, it is highly likely that they will get into
the UG CCA of their choice if they put it as their first choice.</p>
