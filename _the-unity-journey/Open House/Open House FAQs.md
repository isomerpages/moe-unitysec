<br><strong>Can my child qualify for Unity Secondary if his/her score is below the cut off score by 1 or 2 marks?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is advisable for students to put their school of choice as the first
or second place. For the rest of the choices, it must be within their Achievement
Levels.</p>
<p>Cut off scores may fluctuate +/-&nbsp; 1 or 2 points every year, hence
there is no guarantee of placement as students are emplaced based on merit
first and then choice.</p>
<p><strong>Does putting the school as first choice give me higher priority?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, it does, provided your child’s score is within our cut-off range
and vacancies have not been filled by students having higher scores than
your child who have put Unity as their first choice.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>School Structures</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. How many Sec 1 classes do we have in 2024?</strong>
</p>
<p>We have 8 classes of Sec 1 students.</p>
<p><strong>2. How is the form class structure in Unity Sec?</strong>
</p>
<p>We have a CCA mixed form class where we have 2 CCAs forming a form class.
Students will learn the common curriculum subjects in their CCA mixed form
class. Common Curriculum subjects include PE, DT, FCE, Art and Music. The
Character Coaches (Form Teachers) of your child will follow them throughout
the 4–5 years of their education in Unity.</p>
<p><strong>3. How did the school perform in National Examinations?</strong>
</p>
<p>Generally, the school does well in national exams. Annually, at least
95% of our 4 Express students qualify for Polytechnic admission, and at
least 70% qualify for JCs. For our NA students, at least 80% qualify for
Sec 5NA.</p>
<p><strong>4. What is the percentage of students that qualify for Junior Colleges and Polytechnics?</strong>
</p>
<p>Polytechnics: more than 95%
<br>Junior Colleges: more than 70%</p>
<h3>Academic<br></h3>
<p><strong>1. Does the school offer a ‘Triple Science’ Combination?</strong>
</p>
<p>The school does not offer a Triple Science Combination. The offer of subjects
for Upper Secondary is aligned to criteria for admissions to post-secondary
courses in JCs and Polytechnics.</p>
<p><strong>2. Does the school offer Double Science (Pure Physics &amp; Pure Chemistry) with POA?</strong>
</p>
<p>No, the school does not offer such subject combinations. To ensure that
our students qualify for post-secondary admissions to JCs or Polytechnics,
the school ensures that students have the necessary Science, Mathematics,
Humanities, and Elective combinations. POA is not a key requirement even
for Business and Finance courses at Polytechnics.</p>
<p><strong>3. What is the criteria for taking A-Math’ in Secondary 3?</strong>
</p>
<p>To do Additional Mathematics at Upper Secondary level, a strong foundation
in Mathematics at Lower Secondary is necessary. Students who are keen to
take G3 Additional Mathematics should achieve an overall percentage of
60% and above in G3 Mathematics. Those who do not meet the above suggested
criteria can consider taking G2 Additional Mathematics. Do note that for
entry to Junior College, 5 G3 subjects are required.</p>
<h3>CCA<br></h3>

<br>Volleyball: Selection exercise for application through DSA.
<br>Even though we have DSA volleyball students, most of the volleyball team
are selected through the volleyball trial during the CCA Open House and
CCA experience.</p>
<p><strong>3. What are the chances of getting into Uniformed Group (UG) CCA if the students choose it as their first choice?</strong>
</p>
<p>All students will be given priority to go into UG CCA if they put it as
their first choice. Therefore, it is highly likely that they will get into
the UG CCA of their choice if they put it as their 1st choice.</p>
