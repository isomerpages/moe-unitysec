<p>We're absolutely honoured and thrilled to announce that <strong>Unity Secondary School</strong> received
the People's Association Community Spirit Award 2025!&nbsp; &nbsp;We’re
truly grateful for this recognition as we take pride in our community work.
&nbsp;Last year, we participated in several Yew Tee community events such
as the Yew Tee Day, Cloths Swap, MY $1 Deals and North-West Food Sustainability
Festival. &nbsp;We would like to express our thanks to <strong>all our staff, students, parents </strong>and
the close partnership we have with PA and we hope to continue this partnership
moving forward. &nbsp;Congratulations to all other award recipients, and
together, let’s spark and nurture a caring community!</p>
