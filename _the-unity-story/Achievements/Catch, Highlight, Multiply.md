<p>Marcus showed integrity, commitment and compassion this term which is
commendable effort in improving his behaviour and conduct compared to previous
terms.</p>
<p>
<br>He has shown integrity in his actions and words, taking steps to improve
himself after reminders from teachers. Many teachers have seen a marked
improvement in his behaviour and his chinese teacher who used to chase
him for homework, has commented that Marcus has recently shown a more positive
and serious attitude in class and wanted to affirm and encourage his positive
change.
<br>
<br>Marcus has also shown commitment in basketball, giving his best during
training sessions and trying his very best to maintain his positive behaviour
in term 3.</p>
<p>
<br>Lastly, Marcus has shown compassion and care as he was the first to befriend
his new classmate, Max. He engaged in conversations with him in the classroom
and I have seen him trying to explain to Max during bball trainings how
to do certain drills as Max was unsure how to do it as he was new to bball.</p>
<p>
<br>Overall, we would like to commend and affirm Marcus on his positive change
and his effort to be better. Well done, Marcus!</p>
