<h2>School Expectations</h2>
<h4>School Rules &amp; Code Of Conduct</h4>
<p>The school’s School Rules and Code of Conduct are set up to inculcate
good habits and internalise our school values of&nbsp;<strong>Respect, Compassion, Commitment, Integrity and Perseverance</strong>&nbsp;.
As students apply themselves to the Code of Conduct, they will grow to
be Unitians who can&nbsp;<strong>Lead Self, Serve Others, Actualise Self and Inspire Others</strong>&nbsp;.</p>
