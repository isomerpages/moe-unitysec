##### School\_Of\_OpportUNITY

The world is ever changing. Our youths grow up in a world of constant change and information overload. Technology is reshaping the way we communicate, learn, work, build relations and live. Family dynamics and norms are also undergoing changes with far reaching consequences. There is less predictability and there are complex interconnected forces and events at play that is shaping this ‘new’ VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) world. One truism of this new world is life-long learning. Our youths must therefore be prepared to learn, unlearn and re-learn in order to survive and excel in this VUCA world.

The education experience in Unity will prepare our students with key ‘survival skills’ so that they can continue to thrive in this VUCA world. Through our Unity Total Curriculum, we equip our students with enduring skillsets of communication, critical and inventive thinking. Our Curriculum allows our students not only to develop strong academic foundation, but also to build their resilience and hone their leadership competencies.

Guided by our School Philosophy, “Every Unitian is unique, has the potential and can be an inspiration,” a variety of programmes are in place to cater to students of all abilities. Programmes are customised for the different streams to instil the joy of learning through authentic learning experiences. Our Talent Development Programme for English, Mathematics, Science and Humanities nurtures students’ talent in the subjects of their interest. There are also opportunities for students with passion in sports like Basketball and Volleyball to hone their sporting skills through our DSA programmes. Our Applied Learning Programme (Biotechnology in Food Sustainability) exposes our students to higher level research through collaborations with local scientists on research projects. 

Together with the support from parents and partnership with the community, the school establishes a caring and nurturing environment built on the culture of Growth Mindset. With the Growth Mindset as well as numerous learning opportunities, we are committed to bring out the best in our students so that they can Lead Self, Serve Others; Actualise Self and Inspire Others.
