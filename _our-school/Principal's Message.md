<h4><strong>A School of OpportUNITY — Developing Resilient, Future-Ready Learners</strong></h4>
<p>Established in 2000, Unity Secondary School stays true to our mission
of nurturing Unitians to be resilient and future-ready individuals with
the passion to serve and lead. As a <em>School of OpportUNITY</em>, we welcome
students and parents into a vibrant learning community that offers <strong>Rich Opportunities</strong> through
our <strong>EnRiching, Rigorous, and Relevant Programmes</strong>, anchored
on strong <strong>Relationships</strong> between our Character Coaches, teachers,
and students.</p>
<h4><strong>EnRiching – Every Unitian has potential</strong></h4>
<p>At Unity, we believe that every Unitian has the potential to inspire others.
This belief fuels our drive to provide rich learning experiences for all.
Guided by our distinctive <strong>4+1 Curriculum Model</strong> — four days
of Academic Learning and one day of Character Development — Unitians immerse
themselves in deep learning from Monday to Thursday and culminate their
week with meaningful leadership and character-building opportunities every
Friday.</p>
<p>Fridays come alive as our students step up to lead in <strong>CCAs and CCE lessons, </strong>embodying
what it means to be <em>Leaders of Self and Others</em>. This well-loved
structure gives Unitians the balance and bandwidth to excel academically
while growing holistically.</p>
<p>Leadership at Unity is not confined to titles — it is <strong>experienced and practised</strong>.
Whether through <strong>CCA leadership</strong>, the <strong>Leaders of English Programme</strong>, <strong>Young Scientist Programme</strong>,
or <strong>Advanced Mathematics Programme</strong>, students are stretched
to discover their strengths, pursue their passions, and inspire others.
In Unity, our teachers are called <strong>Character Coaches</strong> because
they nurture not just minds, but hearts — developing Unitians into young
gentlemen and ladies who lead with character.</p>
<h4><strong>Rigorous and Relevant – “Every Classroom, a Good Classroom.”</strong></h4>
<p>At Unity Secondary, our teachers are passionate designers of learning.
Through inquiry-driven lesson design, they craft <strong>Active Learning Plus</strong> experiences
where every Unitian is an active learner – <em>learning to do, learning with others,</em> and <em>doing to learn.</em> Technology
energises our classrooms by making learning active, feedback immediate,
and thinking visible.</p>
<p>Our teachers, too, are lifelong learners – constantly innovating and crafting <strong>E21CC lessons</strong> to
future-ready our students for a fast-changing world.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Innovative and Impactful – Learning for the Future</strong></h4>
<p>Our <strong>STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – <em>GreenovAtors in Action (GAIA)</em> </strong>–
equips Unity Secondary students with future-ready skills in design thinking
and problem-based learning. Through GAIA, students become agents of change,
harnessing science and technology to innovate, advocate, and create sustainable
solutions for green urban challenges in sustainable development.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</strong> – <em>Lead through Outdoor and Sports Adventures</em> –
builds on our school values of <strong>REspect, Commitment, Compassion, Integrity, and PErseverance (REC²IPE)</strong>.
Unitians develop leadership, resilience, and teamwork through outdoor experiences
and sports. With our strong niche and winning streak in <strong>Basketball, Table Tennis, Volleyball, and Football</strong>,
Unity exudes a sporting spirit of perseverance, passion, and pride — nurturing
character and a growth mindset in every student.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Collective Strength</strong></h4>
<p>Unity Secondary is truly a <em>School of OpportUNITY</em> because of the
unwavering support from our <strong>dedicated teachers, School Administrative Team, Allied Educators, parents, School Advisory Committee, alumni, and community partners.</strong> Together,
we build a nurturing environment where every Unitian grows to become a <strong>Lifelong Learner and an Inspiring Leader.</strong>
