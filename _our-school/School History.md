<p>Unity Secondary School welcomes our fifth principal Mdm Adel Ong on 16

<p>As a testament to the efforts and contributions of staff, students and
our partners in the journey towards school excellence, Unity Secondary
School made significant achievements in many areas. The school is accorded
niche school status by MOE in Basketball since 2009 and in Uniformed Groups
since 2012. For a holistic student-centric, values-driven education, the
school has developed and implemented two distinctive programmes in 2015
aligned to the School Motto. These distinctive programmes aim to develop
our students into Confident Persons, Self-Directed Learners, Concerned
Citizens and Active Contributors as spelt out in the student outcomes of
the MOE 21st Century Competencies Framework. The Unity Applied Learning
Programme (ALP),&nbsp;<em>"Inspire through Agro-Bio Science and Technology"</em>,
enables students to understand the relevance of STEM(Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) education in solving real life problems.
The Unity Learning for Life Programme(LLP),&nbsp;<em>"Lead through Outdoors and Sporting Adventures"</em>,
entails a three-year self-discovery leadership journey where students learn
to lead themselves, others and teams.</p>
