The official opening ceremony of the school was held on 15 November 2001. The opening ceremony was officiated by Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, then Minister for Communications & Information Technology and MP for Hong Kah GRC.

Since the inception of the school, the set of five School Values – Respect, Commitment, Integrity, Compassion and Perseverance” has been established to guide every cohort of Unitians in their character building.

In 2004, the school celebrated 5 Years of Unity (5th School Anniversary) by presenting the musical “To Oz in Unity”.

On 19 December 2005, Miss Tan Siew Piang took over as the second principal of the school. The vision of developing Unity Secondary School into “A school where students and staff have the Passion to Learn, Drive to Excel and Commitment to Serve” was formulated to provide clear direction for staff and students to embark on the journey of achieving school excellence.

Unity Secondary School welcomed her third Principal, Mr Chan Ying Yin, on 15 December 2009. A holistic student development framework was formulated to guide the school in Academic Education and Character and Citizenship Education. With the focus on leadership learning as a key platform for student development, the School Motto was reformulated as “_Leading Self, Serving Others; Actualising Self. Inspiring Others_”. It espouses the aspiration of every Unitian to be a leader of self and others.
