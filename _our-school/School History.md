The official opening ceremony of the school was held on 15 November 2001. The opening ceremony was officiated by Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, then Minister for Communications & Information Technology and MP for Hong Kah GRC.

Since the inception of the school, the set of five School Values – Respect, Commitment, Integrity, Compassion and Perseverance” has been established to guide every cohort of Unitians in their character building.

In 2004, the school celebrated 5 Years of Unity (5th School Anniversary) by presenting the musical “To Oz in Unity”.

On 19 December 2005, Miss Tan Siew Piang took over as the second principal of the school. The vision of developing Unity Secondary School into “A school where students and staff have the Passion to Learn, Drive to Excel and Commitment to Serve” was formulated to provide clear direction for staff and students to embark on the journey of achieving school excellence.

Unity Secondary School welcomed her third Principal, Mr Chan Ying Yin, on 15 December 2009. A holistic student development framework was formulated to guide the school in Academic Education and Character and Citizenship Education. With the focus on leadership learning as a key platform for student development, the School Motto was reformulated as “_Leading Self, Serving Others; Actualising Self. Inspiring Others_”. It espouses the aspiration of every Unitian to be a leader of self and others.

As a testament to the efforts and contributions of staff, students and our partners in the journey towards school excellence, Unity Secondary School made significant achievements in many areas. The school is accorded niche school status by MOE in Basketball since 2009 and in Uniformed Groups since 2012. For a holistic student-centric, values-driven education, the school has developed and implemented two distinctive programmes in 2015 aligned to the School Motto. These distinctive programmes aim to develop our students into Confident Persons, Self-Directed Learners, Concerned Citizens and Active Contributors as spelt out in the student outcomes of the MOE 21st Century Competencies Framework. The Unity Applied Learning Programme (ALP), _"Inspire through Agro-Bio Science and Technology"_, enables students to understand the relevance of STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education in solving real life problems. The Unity Learning for Life Programme(LLP), _"Lead through Outdoors and Sporting Adventures"_, entails a three-year self-discovery leadership journey where students learn to lead themselves, others and teams.
