<h3>VALUES IN EDUCATION </h3>
<p>Values education is important for our secondary school students because
it helps them develop good character, make ethical decisions, build positive
relationships, understand their roles in society, stay resilient, and prepare
for adulthood.</p>
<p>Unitians who have demonstrated our school values or the practices of the
Leadership Challenge Model (LCM) are affirmed through our school Catch,
Highlight and Multiply platform.</p>
<p>
<br>The table below shows the description of the 5 practices of the <strong>LCM</strong> and
our School Values and <strong>RISE</strong> strategy:</p>

<p>An example of a student who can be affirmed: <em>A student leader who encourages the heart by demonstrating perseverance during a particular difficult CCA session and this inspired his/her juniors to persevere too.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adopting the RISE strategy in positive reinforcement helps create a consistent,
timely, specific, and encouraging approach to affirming students' good
behavior, contributing to a positive learning environment, and promoting
the repetition of desirable actions in Unity.</p>
