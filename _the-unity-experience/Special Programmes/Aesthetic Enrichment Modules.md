<h2>Aesthetic Appreciation Programme</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Aligned with the Aesthetics Education Committee’s vision of nurturing
confident, creative, and resilient students through the Exposure–Enrichment–Experience
approach, the Lower Secondary Aesthetics Enrichment Modules (AEM) were
conducted during Leadership Learning Week for Secondary 1 and during Student
Development Time for Secondary 2.</p>
<p>Over the course of 7–8 hours, Secondary 1 students explored the Performing
Arts, while Secondary 2 students engaged in Visual Arts learning experiences.
These modules provided students with opportunities to discover their artistic
potential, express their creativity, and appreciate the arts in a meaningful
way. The students had a choice of 7 different modules that they could choose
from.</p>
<p>The programme culminated in the Sec 1 AEM Showcase, where students proudly
presented their performing arts pieces, and a Visual Art Exhibition at
the Arterior Wall (Level 2), featuring the vibrant creations of the Secondary
2 students.</p>
