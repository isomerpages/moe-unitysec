<h2>Aesthetic Education</h2>
<p>As articulated by the MOE Arts Education Branch, the role of arts education
is central in nurturing our students’ lively curiosity and inquisitive
minds. This is essential in promoting inventive thinking and fostering
an innovative orientation in all that they do. Arts education also serves
as a gateway to students’ sense of aesthetics, shaping how they perceive
the world around them. Such perspectives help them make meaning of their
lives, culture, and identity.</p>
<p>At Unity Secondary School, our arts education programmes are aligned with
the direction of MOE and anchored in the school’s Holistic Student Development
Framework and Leadership Learning Framework, giving rise to our Aesthetics
Education Framework.</p>
<p>To make arts learning meaningful and progressive, the framework adopts
a three-tiered approach:
<br>&nbsp;🎨 Exposure – Appreciate it: Students are introduced to various
art forms and experiences that deepen their awareness and appreciation
of the arts. ( Performances during assembly programmes such as Multi-Cultural
mix of Music! SG Style!, Sec 1 Performing Arts-Based Learning at Esplanade
)
<br>&nbsp;🎶 Enrichment – Learn it: Students develop their artistic skills
and creative confidence through hands-on learning and guided exploration.
( Aesthetic Appreciation Programme- AAP)
<br>&nbsp;🌟 Experience – Showcase it: Students demonstrate their learning
and express their individuality through authentic performance and exhibition
opportunities.( Battle of the iBands, Unity Got Talent, Sec 1 LLW AAP Showcase,
Arterior)</p>
<p>Through this framework, Unity seeks to nurture confident, creative, and
resilient learners who find joy and meaning in the arts.</p>
