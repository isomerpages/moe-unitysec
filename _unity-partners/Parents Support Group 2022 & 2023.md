Unity Secondary's Parent Support Group (PSG) had organised several programmes&nbsp;and events to provide a platform for parents to come together, to support one&nbsp;another and to support the school in nurturing our children. The Games and Sports&nbsp;Sessions, Dad’s For Life activities, workshops, inspirational sharing and PSG Family&nbsp;Day were very well received by parents from all levels. The PSG also attended&nbsp;several school events to show their support for the school. During the Racial&nbsp;Harmony Day PSG set up booth and prepared different ethnics’ cuisine. The&nbsp;proceeds were channelled to fund the needy students.
