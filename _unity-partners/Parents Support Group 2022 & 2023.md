Unity Secondary's Parent Support Group (PSG) had organised several programmes and events to provide a platform for parents to come together, to support one another and to support the school in nurturing our children. The Games and Sports Sessions, Dad’s For Life activities, workshops, inspirational sharing and PSG Family Day were very well received by parents from all levels. The PSG also attended several school events to show their support for the school. During the Racial Harmony Day PSG set up booth and prepared different ethnics’ cuisine. The proceeds were channelled to fund the needy students.
