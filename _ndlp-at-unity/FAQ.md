#### Personalized Learning Device 

**1 \. Can my child not purchase the device?**

For teaching and learning purposes, every student will be required to have a device. <br>
It is strongly encouraged to purchase the device through our school via MOE’s bulk tender.<br>
In order to ensure a smooth learning experience and uniformity of systems and software, students are encouraged to use the device model prescribed by the school. The device purchased through the school will come with the warranty, insurance and technical support. 

**2 \.  Can we bring our own device?**

Students who  already have their own devices will have to check with the school to ascertain whether the specifications of their existing devices meet our school’s requirements by Feb 2022. <br>
These existing devices **must  be installed with a Device Management Application (DMA**) software to provide a safe learning experience for them and to prevent misuse of the devices. <br>
The DMA is fully funded by the school and will be uninstalled from the devices when they graduate/leave the school.

**3 \. Can my child share the device with his siblings?**

As your child will be using the device during and after school,  we would strongly encourage for them to  have their own device. This will provide them with a smoother learning experience. 

**4 \. Will the PLD and SLS resources replace textbooks?**

With the PLD, this allows students to access curriculum-aligned resources in the SLS in and out of class at their own pace to complement their learning. The PLD and SLS resources will not fully replace textbooks as it serves as curriculum-aligned references for students.

**6 \. What does the device bundle include?**  
  
It includes these items as well as the device ( stylus, charger, mouse, bag, earpiece)  

*   Kensington Combination Cable Lock ( The cable lock is necessary to ensure security of the device in class and out of class)
*   Insurance and Warranty (3-year warranty and 3-year insurance, 2 repairs or 1 replacement claim)

**7 \.  What is the expected weight of the device? Are there concerns that it may be too heavy for students to carry to and from their home on a daily basis?**

MOE has taken factors such as size and weight of the devices into consideration when preparing the tender specifications for the Bulk Tender.  One  considerations of the selection of device is that it will weigh less than 1.5kg and smaller than 13"inch.

**8 \.  What happens if my child's device is spoilt?**

Technical support will be provided to students through:

*    Service-desk  support in School - ICT Centre is open from **730am-4.30pm** every Monday to Friday

-> Trouble-shooting of device issues<br>
-> Solve connectivity issues

*   For repair of devices ( hardware issues) - the device will be collected from the school to be sent for repairs. There is a **2 week** turn-around time. A temporary loan device will be issued to students while waiting for their devices to be repaired.

**9 \. What is the insurance coverage like?**

**10 \. Will my child/ward be allowed to store the device in school overnight? Where will students store their devices when they go for recess or PE lessons?** 

Students are expected to secure their devices to their table using the Kensington cable lock that will be purchased in the device bundle.  Classrooms will be locked when students are out for CCA, recess and PE lessons to ensure greater security. <br>
 Students should bring home the devices at the end of the school day so that they can utilise them for learning at home.

**11 \. How frequently will the devices be used in class? Is there a recommended limit to screen time in class?**

There is no recommended screen time as it depends very much on the nature of the activity. According to the American Academy of Paediatrics (2016), there is no one-size-fits-all approach to limiting the amount of screen time for teenagers. The academy recommends that screen time takes into consideration a child’s developmental stage, how the technology is used, and the quality of the content and design of the material. Schools will design their learning programmes to ensure that the students’ use of PLDs is balanced in relation to other activities and modes of learning.
