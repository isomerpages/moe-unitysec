## NDLP@Unity

#### National Digital Literacy Programme

In March 2020 at MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy.  
  
One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD).

##### <u>Vision: Leading a Student-centred, Self-paced, Blended Learning Classroom</u>

In Unity Secondary School, we are guided by the belief that every Unitian wants to succeed and all Unitians can learn. Your child will experience **active learning with technology**.

The **active learning with technology** can be defined as:

**1 \.** Student ‘**Do**’ – students are motivated and encouraged to articulate (talk), write and even draw to make their thinking visible.

_The above pictures illustrate how students can use their personal learning device in their daily learning._

**2 \.** Students ‘**Think**’ – students will be guided by thinking strategies to monitor and evaluate their own learning and understanding of content taught in class.
