<h2>NDLP@Unity</h2>
<h4>National Digital Literacy Programme</h4>
<p>In March 2020 at MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate,&nbsp;MOE launched the
National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students
strengthen their digital literacy.</p>
<p>One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised
Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby
every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (PLD).</p>
<h5><u>Vision: Leading a Student-centred, Self-paced, Blended Learning Classroom</u></h5>
<p>In Unity Secondary School, we are guided by the belief that every Unitian
wants to succeed and all Unitians can learn. Your child will experience&nbsp;<strong>active learning with technology</strong>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>active learning with technology</strong>&nbsp;can be
defined as:</p>
<p><strong>1 .</strong> Student ‘<strong>Do</strong>’ – students are motivated
and encouraged to articulate (talk), write and even draw to make their
thinking visible.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>2 .</strong> Students ‘<strong>Think</strong>’ – students will
be guided by thinking strategies to monitor and evaluate their own learning
and understanding of content taught in class.</p>

<p><strong>3 .</strong> Students ‘<strong>Apply</strong>’ – students will
be able to use learning in real life context and learn beyond the classroom.
The world is our classroom.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>4 .</strong> Students ‘<strong>Refine</strong>’ – students are
able to apply reflection and deepen their understanding of all subjects
and continue to learn.</p>
<p><strong>To achieve our vision:</strong>
</p>
<p>All Unitians will have access to quality devices and resources for learning
to take place anytime, anywhere and at their own pace.</p>
