## NDLP@Unity

#### National Digital Literacy Programme

In March 2020 at MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy.  
  
One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD).

##### <u>Vision: Leading a Student-centred, Self-paced, Blended Learning Classroom</u>

In Unity Secondary School, we are guided by the belief that every Unitian wants to succeed and all Unitians can learn. Your child will experience **active learning with technology**.
