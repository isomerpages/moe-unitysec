The Unity Advanced Mathematics Programme (AMP) aims to instill the joy of learning within our students, deepen their interest towards mathematics, heighten their level of resilience and provide platforms to challenge them cognitively. This program seeks to prepare our students for the VUCA world by equipping them with problem solving skills, focusing on the 5 aspects of the Singapore's Mathematics Framework (i.e. mathematical intuition, reasoning, logical, creative and critical thinking). In this program, students can look forward to workshops, learning journeys,trainings and competitions that will enrich their learning of mathematics.
