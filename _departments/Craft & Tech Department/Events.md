## Events

The Craft & Technology department comprises of three units – Design and Technology, Nutrition and Food Science and Arts. The programme develops the students’ innate ability to create things through creative thinking and investigative experiences. Students learn to appreciate and emphatise real-world problems, and critically think about solutions, resulting in innovative ideas both in functions and aesthetics. They also embark on learning journeys and participate in competitions to extend the learning beyond classrooms. Students also get opportunities to display their work in the school and public spaces that brings about a sense of achievement and pride.
