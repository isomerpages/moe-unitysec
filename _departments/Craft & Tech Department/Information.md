<h4><strong>Design &amp; Technology</strong></h4>
<p>The aim of Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T) is to enable pupils to harness
their innate curiosity and ability to create through design-and-make activities.
It enables students to develop their dispositions for enterprise, creativity
and innovation by identifying and responding to design needs through the
process of research and observation, idea conceptualisation and development,
graphic communication and working with appropriate tools and materials.</p>
<p>D&amp;T is a compulsory subject for lower secondary students, while at
upper secondary level, it is offered as an elective for interested students.
Lower secondary students do not sit for a written examination, but they
submit their coursework for assessment instead. Upper secondary students
have to submit their coursework and sit for written examinations as part
of their assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogies &amp; Modes of Teaching</strong>
</p>
<p>Coursework is a core component of the curriculum for this subject, transcending
all levels from Secondary 1 to 5. Through execution of the coursework and
practical activities, students articulate their design problem solving
capabilities.</p>
<p>During Secondary 1 and 2, the emphasis is on understanding and appreciating
the whole design cycle. During Secondary 3, the focus is on enhancing the
research and decision making aspects, as well as to improve students’ ability
in doodling and sketching for ideas exploration.</p>

<h4><strong>Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The NFS Curriculum Framework provides a holistic approach to developing
students as Health Ambassadors, Discerning Consumers, and Food Innovators.
Grounded in the key strands of nutrition and health, consumer literacy,
and food science, it connects classroom learning to real-life applications
through hands-on, reflective, and student-centred experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Lower Secondary, the Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE) programme
empowers students to make informed food and lifestyle choices. They explore
nutrition, food safety, resource management, and sustainable living while
applying basic culinary science to prepare healthy meals. Through practical
learning, students build essential life skills such as critical thinking,
creativity, and communication, and develop positive attitudes like confidence,
curiosity, empathy, and responsibility.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Upper Secondary, Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) deepens students’
understanding of the relationship between nutrition, health, and sustainability.
Through Active Learning Plus, students explore scientific principles behind
food preparation and innovation, applying them creatively to design healthier
and more sustainable food products. In the process, they strengthen 21st
Century Competencies (E21CC) such as inventive thinking, responsible decision-making,
and effective communication — preparing them to lead with purpose and contribute
to a healthier, sustainable future.

<h4><strong>Music</strong></h4>
<p>Students will have the opportunities to explore their environment through
sounds and develop a connection with music through experiences that are
meaningful and valuable. These include the ability to listen, sing, play,
create and express themselves musically.</p>
<p>At lower secondary level, all students will have an opportunity to learn
and perform with 1-2 musical instruments as well as create their own music
during their music lesson.</p>
<p>Through the Music curriculum, students will be introduced to a wide range
of genres and styles to put them in touch with their heritage as well as
deepen their understanding of the cultural diversity of music in Singapore
and the world.</p>
