<h2>Events</h2>
<p><strong><u>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight </u></strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>The MTL department organises MTL fortnight programmes to immerse students
in Mother Tongue languages and cultures. These activities provide authentic
opportunities for cultural learning, including Chinese pop cultures, traditional
Chinese games, Dikir Barat, Silat, Indian drama workshops, and learning
journeys. Through these activities, we aim to enrich our students’ cultural
and language learning experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>MT Language and Cultural Camp</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue Language and Cultural Camp aims to provide students
with opportunities to appreciate their own cultures through hands-on tasks
such as drama, performances, and storytelling. Each of our Secondary Two
students will have the experience of participating in the day camp.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Festive Celebrations (CNY, Hari Raya and Deepavali)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The MTL department organises celebratory activities for major festive
occasions such as Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, and Deepavali. These celebrations
will closely align with Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons,
where students will have the opportunity to understand the values and cultural
significance associated with these celebrations. The activities planned
for students include mass Lohei@Unity during Chinese New Year, as well
as concerts for Hari Raya and Deepavali.</p>
