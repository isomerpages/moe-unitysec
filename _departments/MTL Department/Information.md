**Pedagogies & Modes of Instruction**<br>
_Differentiation Instructions_<br>
This approach enables the classroom activities to cater to the different learning ability students. It allows the students to learn from each other strength and improve on their weaknesses. We participated in the 10C project to better infuse differentiated instruction in the Chinese Language  ICT lesson.

_Task-based instruction_ <br>
This is the student centered approach. Learning tasks are designed to provide opportunity for the students to apply their knowledge learnt. One of the projects tasked to Sec 3 students are for them to design a cultural game for Sec one student to participate.

Collaborative and self-directed learning styles are also encourage through project work, peer assessment and ICT lesson. Project based assignment has designed for students to work in team. Team members are to monitor the progress of the teamwork and a presentation is required to round up the project.

We also harness on multi-media resources to make learning more interesting.  Students are given the opportunity to use Blog to comment on certain topic.
