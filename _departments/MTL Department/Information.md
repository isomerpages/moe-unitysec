## Information

#### Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department

The Mother Tongue Language Department focuses on building language skills as well as to promote language and cultural appreciation in Unitians.
In alignment with Strategic Thrust 2 for nurturing engaged learners, the Mother Tongue Curriculum is tailored to meet the diverse learning needs of all student groups. 


**Pedagogies &amp; Modes of Instruction**<br>
The lessons in MTL (Mother Tongue Language) classrooms are designed according to the Active Learning process. This approach aims to activate learning, promote thinking and discussion, facilitate the demonstration of learning, and enable teachers to monitor and provide necessary feedback. To ensure that lesson objectives are effectively met, MTL lessons in Unity are designed based on the Department's Baseline Pedagogies for Reading, Writing, and Speaking.

Our teachers also leverage the affordances of technology to enhance studentsâ€™ learning experiences in class. Students benefit from instant feedback, collaborative activities, and opportunities for creative and critical thinking during lessons. The Differentiated Instruction (DI) approach enables classroom activities to accommodate the diverse learning needs of students. It allows students to learn from each other's strengths and improve upon their weaknesses.
