<h2>Information</h2>
<h4>English Language &amp; English Literature</h4>
<p>The English Language and Literature curriculum in Unity Secondary School
is anchored by the Active Learning @ USS approach. In Unity Secondary School,
the English Language and Literature lessons are designed to equip students
with the 21st century competencies across all areas of language learning.</p>
<p><u>School-wide Reading Programme</u>
<br>To facilitate extensive reading and cultivate good reading habits, the
English Department has implemented a comprehensive school-wide reading
programme aimed at providing a conducive learning environment where Unitians
are encouraged to be&nbsp;<strong>engaged</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>critical</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>informed</strong>&nbsp;readers.
Through use of curated reading materials designed by our EL and Lit teachers,
students learn to be discerning readers while building good general knowledge
and comprehension skills. At the same time, students are given the&nbsp;<strong>autonomy</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>agency</strong>&nbsp;to
choose reading materials from digital repositories such as Libby (NLB),
making reading engaging and accessible to them.</p>
<p><u>Pedagogies &amp; Modes of Teaching</u>
<br><strong>The Active Learning Approach for English Department</strong>
</p>
<p>In Unity Secondary School, the English Department aims to make every English
Language and Literature class a Student-Centred, Self-Paced and Blended
learning class. Through mapping of the CLEARR framework to the Active Learning
Process, lessons are designed in a structured manner to activate learning,
promote thinking and discussion, facilitate demonstration of learning and
lastly, monitor and provide necessary feedback. To ensure objectives are
met and executed seamlessly, English lessons in Unity are designed with
the Department Baseline Pedagogies for Reading, Writing and Speaking in
mind.</p>
<p>There is a pedagogical emphasis on Multi-literacies, Metacognition and
Inquiry through Dialogue as students practise&nbsp;<strong>Blended Learning</strong>&nbsp;using
their Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) in the classroom. Students are given
opportunities to craft their learning experiences and make thinking visible
through collaborative work. This encourages co-construction of knowledge
and allows them to enjoy self-paced flipped classroom experiences via Student
Learning Space (SLS).</p>
<p>Differentiated Instruction (DI) is a teaching approach catered to students’
interests, preferences, strengths and struggles. Through DI, learning environments
and experiences are tailored to suit all students’ learning needs while
focusing on the same learning goal. In Unity Secondary School, DI may come
in the form of flexible small grouping and reciprocal learning to maximise
students’ learning.&nbsp;</p>
