## Information

#### English Language & English Literature

The English Language and Literature curriculum in Unity Secondary School is anchored by the Active Learning @ USS approach. In Unity Secondary School, the English Language and Literature lessons are designed to equip students with the 21st century competencies across all areas of language learning.

<b><u>School-wide Reading Programme</b></u><br>
To facilitate extensive reading and cultivate good reading habits, the English Department has implemented a comprehensive school-wide reading programme aimed at providing a conducive learning environment where Unitians are encouraged to be **engaged**, **critical** and **informed** readers. Through use of curated reading materials designed by our EL and Lit teachers, students learn to be discerning readers while building good general knowledge and comprehension skills. At the same time, students are given the **autonomy** and **agency** to choose reading materials from digital repositories such as Libby (NLB), making reading engaging and accessible to them.

<b><u>Pedagogies & Modes of Teaching</b></u><br>
**The Active Learning Approach for English Department**

In Unity Secondary School, the English Department aims to make every English Language and Literature class a Student-Centred, Self-Paced and Blended learning class. Through mapping of the CLEARR framework to the Active Learning Process, lessons are designed in a structured manner to activate learning, promote thinking and discussion, facilitate demonstration of learning and lastly, monitor and provide necessary feedback. To ensure objectives are met and executed seamlessly, English lessons in Unity are designed with the Department Baseline Pedagogies for Reading, Writing and Speaking in mind.

There is a pedagogical emphasis on Multi-literacies, Metacognition and Inquiry through Dialogue as students practise **Blended Learning** using their Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) in the classroom. Students are given opportunities to craft their learning experiences and make thinking visible through collaborative work. This encourages co-construction of knowledge and allows them to enjoy self-paced flipped classroom experiences via Student Learning Space (SLS).

Differentiated Instruction (DI) is a teaching approach catered to students’ interests, preferences, strengths and struggles. Through DI, learning environments and experiences are tailored to suit all students’ learning needs while focusing on the same learning goal. In Unity Secondary School, DI may come in the form of flexible small grouping and reciprocal learning to maximise students’ learning.

#### Music

The Music Programme at Unity Secondary School aims to develop in students an appreciation for music. Students gain an awareness of and appreciation for music of various cultures and the role of music in daily living. They also develop ability for creative expression through music making. We hope the Music Programme will provide the basis for students to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music.

The Music Programme is offered to all students and it serves as a platform for students to experience music through listening, performing and creating. The modular structure of the Music Programme allows the students to acquire skills in instrumental playing (Keyboard and Ukulele), singing as well as compositional skills (song cover and EDM creation). We use Experience-Concept-Application (ECA) and Active Learning as our main pedagogical approaches for the learning of music concepts and acquisition of musical understandings.
