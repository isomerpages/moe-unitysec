The EL Department aims to nurture Unitians into effective users of the English Language.  Our experiential, skills-based and developmental EL Programme that comprises the Leaders for English Programme (LEP), EL Learning Journeys and our school reading programme, strives to equip Unitians with the language skills to:

·         listen, read and write critically and independently.

·         communicate with accuracy and efficiency for different purposes, audiences, contexts and cultures.

·         view and critically analyse a wide range of texts.

·         appreciate the subtleties of language at the literal, inferential and evaluative levels.

·         use internationally acceptable English to understand and respond to global issues.
