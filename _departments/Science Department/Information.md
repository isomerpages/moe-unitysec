<h2>Information</h2>
<h4>Science</h4>
<p>The science syllabuses are intended to bring about scientific literacy
in students.</p>
<p>The general aims of the various disciplines in science are to enable students
to:
<br>1 . appreciate the natural world.
<br>2 . appreciate how science has contributed to the historical and cultural
development of our society.
<br>3 . develop skills of scientific inquiry through making observations,
coming up with hypotheses, designing and carrying out experiments to collect
and analyse data so as to obtain evidence to support or disprove hypotheses
made.
<br>4 . understand the importance of experimental evidence when making decisions.
<br>5 . develop awareness of the conclusions of important scientific theories
so as to apply such knowledge in the natural world.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogies &amp; mode of instruction</strong>
<br>Various pedagogical approaches are used in the teaching of science in
the classroom to enable students to acquire the skills and knowledge outlined
in the various science syllabuses. Often there is an overlap of various
pedagogies within a lesson to effectively engage students in learning.</p>
<p><em>Direct instruction</em>
<br>Basically teacher-directed where face-to-face instruction by teachers
is done with carefully articulated lessons. Trigger activities at the start
of such lessons are often used to gain the attention of the students. Scientific
thinking and inquiry is enhanced is such lessons with the use of video
resources, comics, stories and demonstrations to hold students attention.</p>
<p><em>Self-directed learning and Collaborative learning (SDL/CoL)</em>
<br>Problem based learning (PBL) helps students to understand basic science
concepts longer when they are learned by self-discovery through exploration
and discussion from problems faced in a practical real-world context. An
essential and distinctive feature of this approach is that problems come
first and introduce content, rather than problems following a presentation
of facts and concepts. Students learn on a need-to-know basis either individually
or in groups. Students become self-directed and collaborative learners
in the use of PBL in the classroom. SDL/CoL is further enhanced with the
use of ICT platforms such as Edomodo, Applets and other on-line resources.</p>
<p><em>Practical lessons</em>
<br>Practical work is integral to science education. Through practical lessons
students observe or manipulate real objects, laboratory apparatus and materials
individually or in small groups or by witness teacher demonstrations. Practical
lessons enable students to develop scientific inquiry and practical skills.
Students also gain a better understanding of scientific knowledge learned
in the classroom and builds confidence in students. Practical work stimulates
interest and enjoyment in the learning of science and gives insight into
the scientific method. Students also develop ‘scientific attitudes’ such
as open-mindedness and objectivity through the learning of science via
practical work.</p>
