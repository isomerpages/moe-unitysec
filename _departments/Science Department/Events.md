<h2>Events</h2>
<p>The Science Department’s signature talent development programme is the
Young Scientists Programme (YSP), conceptualised and first implemented
in 2009. YSP engages students with deep interest and aptitude in science
by showing them the real-world relevance of science. The programme stretches
students with workshops and learning journeys in science and technology
to give students exposure to science beyond the classrooms. It also serves
as a platform for students to engage in STEM research and to give them
the opportunity to participate in various STEM competitions.</p>
