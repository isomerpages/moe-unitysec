## Events

The Science Departmentâ€™s signature programme is the Young Scientists Programme (YSP), conceptualised and first implemented in 2009. YSP engages students with deep interest and aptitude in science by showing them the real-world relevance of science. The programme stretches students with workshops, seminars and conferences in the different sub-disciplines of science and gives students exposure to science beyond the classrooms. It also serves as a platform, in collaboration with external agencies, for students to engage in science research and gives them the opportunitiy to participate invarious science competitions.  The YSP students also represent the school in various science competitions. 

The Unity Scientific Innovation Challenge in collaboration with Singapore Polytechnic and ERI@N (USPE), an annual zonal science competition organised by Unity Secondary School, is also a part of the YSP programme.
