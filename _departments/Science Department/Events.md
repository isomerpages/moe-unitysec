<h2>Events</h2>
<p>The Science Department’s signature programme is the Young Scientists Programme
(YSP), conceptualised and first implemented in 2009. YSP engages students
with deep interest and aptitude in science by showing them the real-world
relevance of science. The programme stretches students with workshops,
seminars and conferences in the different sub-disciplines of science and
gives students exposure to science beyond the classrooms. It also serves
as a platform, in collaboration with external agencies, for students to
engage in science research and gives them the opportunitiy to participate
invarious science competitions. The YSP students also represent the school
in various science competitions.</p>
