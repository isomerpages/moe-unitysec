## Events

The Science Departmentâ€™s signature programme is the Young Scientist Programme (YSP) which was conceptualized and implemented in 2009. The programme stretches students with interest and aptitude in science with workshops, seminars and conferences in the different disciplines of science and gives students exposure to science beyond the classrooms. It also serves as a platform for students to come together for research projects and collaboration with external agencies to enhance their knowledge in science further. The YSP students also represent the school in various science competitions. The annual Unity Scientific Innovation Challenge (USIC) is also a part of the YSP programme.
