#### History

History is a compulsory subject for all lower secondary students in Express and Normal (Academic) courses. Students will learn about Singapore’s national history as well as their Asian heritage through a thematic approach to learning about the Ancient History of India, Southeast Asia and China. In addition, students will be introduced to the process of historical inquiry, which helps them to develop critical thinking skills through opportunities to interpret and evaluate historical sources.

Student will also be introduced to basic Financial Literacy and Economic Literacy as part of the syllabus. These concepts serves to help our students understand the world they live in and to manage themselves better and making informed decisions.

**Pedagogies & Modes of Teaching**

The teaching and learning of History is done through a variety of teaching strategies, which revolve around the Inquiry-Based Approach. Teachers will adopt different strategies to ensure interest in lessons and to keep students motivated and focused.

Cooperative learning with the aid of ICT tools is also used to encourage self-directed learning as well as higher order thinking.

**Key Programmes & Activities**

Students will take part in Inquiry-Based Projects where they can conduct historical investigations, while picking up valuable research and collaborative skills.

#### Social Studies (NT)

The Social Studies (NT) syllabus was implemented with the aim to provide students who are in the predominantly technical-vocational curriculum with a holistic education through the study of the humanities. In Secondary 1, students cover topics on Nationhood and Singapore in the Nation-Building Phase and in Secondary 2, the topics covered are Governance, Living in Peace and Harmony, Managing Our Environment and Looking Ahead. In Secondary 3, students will cover topics on Managing Financial Resources and in Secondary 4, they will look at issues about developing a caring society.

**Pedagogies & Modes of Teaching**

Inquiry-Based Learning infused in Project Work

#### Geography

<u>Geography</u>

Geography students can expect to acquire a wide range of knowledge and skills to understand and explain physical and human phenomena, contemporary environmental and social issues that occur in different places and cultures.

They can expect to acquire insights into future challenges through the study of contemporary geographical issues of national, regional and global importance.

Equipped with the skills of gathering and analysing information as well as an inquiring mind to seek answers to issues affecting our lives and the world we live in, Geography students will be prepared for their roles as informed citizens in the 21st century.

The subject will enable students to appreciate the interdependence and fragility of the local and global environment, and the importance of achieving sustainable development.

Geography will also help students develop appropriate attitudes and values that are needed to ensure the sustainable use of resources, preservation of natural environments and the well-being of human society.

**Pedagogies & Modes of Teaching**

There are mainly three modes of teaching used in Geography.

Inquiry-based learning will be the main approach in Geography. This approach facilitates the examination of current issues and problems at the local, regional or global scale from a geographical perspective.

Field-based learning is one of the distinctive attributes of Geography. It is a teaching approach that is valuable in providing our students with ‘hands-on’ experiences to enhance their learning.

Case studies are an integral part of the Geography syllabuses. They provide our students with opportunities to understand, draw links and apply concepts, patterns and processes to situations in the real world.
