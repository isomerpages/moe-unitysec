<h2>Information</h2>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>The Lower Secondary History syllabuses seek to imbue in our students a
sense of national identity by helping them understand and appreciate the
Singapore they live in today. Students will gain an understanding of Singapore's
connection with rest of the world as part of the global trading network
prior to the establishment of a British trading post. They will also understand
our experiences of being a port city under British rule as well as our
experiences under Japanese occupation. Lastly, students will understand
Singapore's journey towards independence and how Singaporeans' sense of
belonging, reality and hope was fostered in the newly independent nation
state.</p>
<h4>Learning Through Geographical Inquiry</h4>
<p>The Geography Curriculum Concept articulates teaching with inquiry as
a signature pedagogy of Geography educators and hence recommends the Geographical
Inquiry Process (GIP) for both classroom instruction and fieldwork. Learning
through inquiry stimulates students’ interest in Geography and empowers
them to take responsibility for their learning. The inquiry-based pedagogical
approach seeks to shift students from a reliance on memorising information
to actively construct new knowledge and understanding through comprehension,
extraction and application of information from varied sources. The use
of geographical inquiry is thus at the heart of Geography instruction and
learning, and students will be provided with the opportunities to learn
the skills required through practice and engagement in geographical inquiry.</p>

<h4>Upper Sec Geography</h4>
<p><strong>Bite-sized and Extended Fieldwork</strong>
</p>
<p>The Upper Secondary Geography has introduced Bite-sized and Extended Fieldwork
into the different syllabuses to allow fieldwork skills to be taught within
curriculum time. Fieldwork is integral to Geography learning, putting theories
into context and energising students to investigate surroundings beyond
their classroom walls. Therefore, students learn about fieldwork through
the inquiry approach, so they have the opportunity to explore different
inquiries and hone abilities in knowledge construction. For Humanities
(Geography) syllabuses, students will do Bite-sized Fieldwork. For Geography
syllabuses, 10 weeks are allocated for students to carry out Extended Fieldwork.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Geospatial Technology in Geographical Inquiry</strong>
</p>
<p>The advancement of computer hardware and software has made geospatial
data and technologies more accessible to teachers and students. Geospatial
technologies, for example remote sensing, geographic information systems,
Internet mapping and global positioning systems, are used to collect and
process data about specific locations on Earth. Geospatial data and technologies
can be readily incorporated into web-based learning activities to enhance
students’ learning. For example, students will explore a variety of digital
content such as images, statistics and graphs using interactive web maps
available from the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS). The use of 360o
virtual reality technology can also provide students with an immersive
experience of field sites prior to and/or after primary data collection.
When appropriately applied, teaching with geospatial technology would contribute
towards the development of 21CC among students.</p>
<p><strong>Blended Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>With Blended Learning, teachers curate teaching and learning activities
that provide students with a seamless learning experience through a range
of learning opportunities in school and beyond. In delivering the Geography
curriculum through Blended Learning, traditional in-class learning should
be thoughtfully integrated with other learning approaches such as technology-based
approaches to bring about an even more effective and student- centric educational
experience. Teachers can also use the Student Learning Space Pedagogical
Scaffold (SLSPS) 2.0 when designing these experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes &amp; Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will take part in Inquiry-Based Projects where they can conduct
historical&nbsp;investigations,&nbsp;while picking up valuable research
and collaborative skills.</p>
<h4>Social Studies (NT)</h4>
<p>The Social Studies curriculum at the NT level/ G1 level seek to prepare
students to be effective citizens by helping them understand the interconnectedness
of Singapore and the world they live in, and to appreciate the complexities
of the human experience through inquiry into real world issues. Some of
the topics covered in Lower Secondary Social Studies include how Singaporeans
can live in a multi-cultural society, embrace migration, resolve conflict
and protect the environment. At the Upper Secondary level, the NT students
continue the Social Studies curriculum by exploring issues such as globalisation,
management of financial resources as well as building a caring nation and
inclusive society.</p>
<p>Additionally, for the Secondary 1 G1 Humanities students, students are
also exposed to three Humanities Exposure Modules (HEMs) in Geography,
History and Literature in English. Some of the topics covered in HEMs include
relationship with the national environment (Geography) and the diverse
learning experiences in colonial Singapore (History). The HEMs provide
students with an all rounded experience in the humanities that will allow
them to understand people's relationship with self, society and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogies &amp; Modes of Teaching</strong>
</p>
<p>Inquiry-Based Learning infused in Project Work</p>
<p>Problem-Based Learning</p>
<h4>Geography</h4>
<p><u>Geography</u>
</p>
<p>Geography students can expect to acquire a wide range of knowledge and
skills to understand and explain physical and human phenomena, contemporary
environmental and social issues that occur in different places and cultures.</p>
<p>They can expect to acquire insights into future challenges through the
study of contemporary geographical issues of national, regional and global
importance.</p>
<p>Equipped with the skills of gathering and analysing information as well
as an inquiring mind to seek answers to issues affecting our lives and
the world we live in, Geography students will be prepared for their roles
as informed citizens in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The subject will enable students to appreciate the interdependence and
fragility of the local and global&nbsp;environment,&nbsp;and the importance
of achieving sustainable development.</p>
<p>Geography will also help students develop appropriate attitudes and values
that are needed to ensure the sustainable use of resources, preservation
of natural environments and the well-being of human society.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogies &amp; Modes of Teaching</strong>
</p>
<p>Inquiry-based learning will be the main approach in Geography. This approach
facilitates the examination of current issues and problems at the local,
regional or global scale from a geographical perspective.</p>
<p>Field-based learning is one of the distinctive attributes of Geography.
It is a teaching approach that is valuable in providing our students with
‘hands-on’ experiences to enhance their learning.</p>
<p>Case studies are an integral part of the Geography syllabuses. They provide
our students with opportunities to understand, draw links and apply concepts,
patterns and processes to situations in the real world.</p>

<h4>Combined Humanities</h4>
<p>Combined Humanities is a compulsory subject to be taken by all Express
and Normal Academic students in our school. It is made up of two components.
All students will take Social Studies. In addition, students will choose
to take an elective. In our school, Geography and History electives are
offered.</p>
<p><strong>Social Studies</strong>&nbsp;will allow students the opportunity
to explore issues concerning societies in this interdependent world. The
subject will help students develop a global perspective and be a responsible
member&nbsp;in&nbsp;local and world community.</p>
<p><strong>Geography Elective</strong>&nbsp;students can expect to acquire
a wide range of knowledge and skills to understand and explain physical
and human phenomena, contemporary environmental and social issues that
occur in different places and cultures. They can expect to acquire insights
into future challenges through the study of contemporary geographical issues
of national, regional and global importance.</p>
<p><strong>History Elective</strong>&nbsp;is a subject where students actively
engage in historical inquiry to develop themselves into confident, self-directed,
critical and reflective thinkers. Students will learn about concepts centred
around events after World War I, World War II and the Cold War. Students
will develop the ability to organise and communicate their historical knowledge
and understanding through a variety of ways. They will develop the ability
to ask relevant questions about the past and examine a range of sources
critically in their historical context to reach substantiated judgments
about the past.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogies &amp; Modes of Teaching</strong>
</p>
<p>There are mainly three modes of teaching used in Combined Humanities.</p>
<p>Inquiry-based learning will be the main approach in all three components
of the subject. This approach facilitates the examination of current issues
and problems at the local, regional or global scale from different perspectives
that is subject specific.</p>
<p><strong><em>Social Studies</em></strong>
</p>
<p>ICT is a feature of the Inquiry-based Learning approach used in Social
Studies. Students will have the opportunity to discuss and explore new
knowledge through the use of ICT-enhanced lessons.</p>
<p><strong><em>Geography</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Field-based learning is one of the distinctive attributes of Geography.
It is a teaching approach that is valuable in providing our students with
‘hands-on’ experiences to enhance their learning. Case studies are an integral
part of the Geography syllabuses. They provide our students with opportunities
to understand, draw links and apply concepts, patterns and processes to
situations in the real world.</p>
<p><strong><em>History</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Historical inquiry units are planned for students to discover knowledge
on their own and linkages to the present situation by drawing parallels.
These are important aspects of the Inquiry-based Learning approach used.
These help to make students’ learning more meaningful and improve their
retention of knowledge.</p>
