<h2>Information</h2>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>The Lower Secondary History syllabuses seek to imbue in our students a
sense of national identity by helping them understand and appreciate the
Singapore they live in today. Students will gain an understanding of Singapore's
connection with rest of the world as part of the global trading network
prior to the establishment of a British trading post. They will also understand
our experiences of being a port city under British rule as well as our
experiences under Japanese occupation. Lastly, students will understand
Singapore's journey towards independence and how Singaporeans' sense of
belonging, reality and hope was fostered in the newly independent nation
state.</p>
<p>Historical inquiry is the key pedagogy for the teaching of History. The
use of inquiry in the History classroom allows students to reflect on historical
questions and issues, and investigate about the past and make reasoned
historical interpretations.</p>
<p>Historical inquiry, which reflects the process of “doing history”, entails
four phases: sparking curiosity, gathering evidence, exercising reasoning
and reflective thinking (see figure below).Through these phases, students
are guided through a process to construct, interpret and evaluate knowledge
from different perspectives. Students will also monitor, assess and improve
their learning.</p>

<p><strong>Key Programmes &amp; Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will take part in Inquiry-Based Projects where they can conduct
historical investigations,&nbsp;while picking up valuable research and
collaborative skills.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Geography</h4>
<p>The Geography Curriculum Concept articulates teaching with inquiry as
a signature pedagogy of Geography educators and hence recommends the Geographical
Inquiry Process (GIP) for both classroom instruction and fieldwork. Learning
through inquiry stimulates students’ interest in Geography and empowers
them to take responsibility for their learning. The inquiry-based pedagogical
approach seeks to shift students from a reliance on memorising information
to actively construct new knowledge and understanding through comprehension,
extraction and application of information from varied sources. The use
of geographical inquiry is thus at the heart of Geography instruction and
learning, and students will be provided with the opportunities to learn
the skills required through practice and engagement in geographical inquiry.</p>

<h4>Social Studies (NT)</h4>
<p>The Social Studies curriculum at the NT level/ G1 level seek to prepare
students to be effective citizens by helping them understand the interconnectedness
of Singapore and the world they live in, and to appreciate the complexities
of the human experience through inquiry into real world issues. Some of
the topics covered in Lower Secondary Social Studies include how Singaporeans
can live in a multi-cultural society, embrace migration, resolve conflict
and protect the environment. At the Upper Secondary level, the NT students
continue the Social Studies curriculum by exploring issues such as globalisation,
management of financial resources as well as building a caring nation and
inclusive society.</p>
<p>Additionally, for the Secondary 1 G1 Humanities students, students are
also exposed to three Humanities Exposure Modules (HEMs) in Geography,
History and Literature in English. Some of the topics covered in HEMs include
relationship with the national environment (Geography) and the diverse
learning experiences in colonial Singapore (History). The HEMs provide
students with an all rounded experience in the humanities that will allow
them to understand people's relationship with self, society and the environment.</p>

<h4><strong>Upper Secondary Humanities</strong></h4>
<h4>Combined Humanities</h4>
<p>Combined Humanities is a compulsory subject to be taken by all Express
and Normal Academic students in our school. It is made up of two components.
All students will take Social Studies. In addition, students will choose
to take an elective. In our school, Geography and History electives are
offered.</p>
<p><strong>Social Studies</strong>&nbsp;will allow students the opportunity
to explore issues concerning societies in this interdependent world. The
subject will help students develop a global perspective and be a responsible
member&nbsp;in&nbsp;local and world community.</p>
<p><strong>Geography Elective</strong>&nbsp;students can expect to acquire
a wide range of knowledge and skills to understand and explain physical
and human phenomena, contemporary environmental and social issues that
occur in different places and cultures. They can expect to acquire insights
into future challenges through the study of contemporary geographical issues
of national, regional and global importance.</p>
<p><strong>History Elective</strong>&nbsp;is a subject where students actively
engage in historical inquiry to develop themselves into confident, self-directed,
critical and reflective thinkers. Students will learn about concepts centred
around events after World War I, World War II and the Cold War. Students
will develop the ability to organise and communicate their historical knowledge
and understanding through a variety of ways. They will develop the ability
to ask relevant questions about the past and examine a range of sources
critically in their historical context to reach substantiated judgments
about the past.</p>
<p><strong>Pedagogies &amp; Modes of Teaching</strong>
</p>
<p>Inquiry-based learning will be the main approach in all three components
of the subject. This approach facilitates the examination of current issues
and problems at the local, regional or global scale from different perspectives
that is subject specific.</p>
<p><strong><em>Social Studies</em></strong>
</p>
<p>ICT is a feature of the Inquiry-based Learning approach used in Social
Studies. Students will have the opportunity to discuss and explore new
knowledge through the use of ICT-enhanced lessons.</p>
<p><strong><em>Geography</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Field-based learning is one of the distinctive attributes of Geography.
It is a teaching approach that is valuable in providing our students with
‘hands-on’ experiences to enhance their learning. Case studies are an integral
part of the Geography syllabuses. They provide our students with opportunities
to understand, draw links and apply concepts, patterns and processes to
situations in the real world.</p>
<p><strong><em>History</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Historical inquiry units are planned for students to discover knowledge
on their own and linkages to the present situation by drawing parallels.
These are important aspects of the Inquiry-based Learning approach used.
These help to make students’ learning more meaningful and improve their
retention of knowledge.</p>
