<h2>Events</h2>
<p>This year, our school launched the Humanities Talent Development Programme
(HTDP) with the objective of nurturing students’ passion for the Humanities
and extending their learning beyond the academic syllabus. The programme
seeks to develop students’ critical understanding of History and Geography
while providing opportunities to explore real-world applications of these
disciplines. As part of the programme, four Secondary 4 students participated
in the Jurong Pioneer Model United Nations, where they represented different
countries as delegates and engaged in deliberations on global issues. Through
this experience, students honed their research, analytical, and public
speaking skills, while gaining valuable insights through interactions with
delegates from other schools. Additionally, selected students visited the
"Sojourners to Citizens - The Citizenship Journey Roving Exhibition" at
Nanyang Girls’ High School to learn about Singapore’s citizenship journey,
which deepened their appreciation of the nation’s history and identity.
In addition, we are also glad to announce that the two teams that we had
sent for the National Library Board (NLB)'s Historical Scene Investigation
(H.S.I.) Challenge had achieved the Gold and Bronze award respectively.</p>
