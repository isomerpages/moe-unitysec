## Events

The Humanities programme equips our students with the right set of skills and values to adapt and remain relevant while navigating the global landscape. In addition, the programme develops students to understand the physical world that they live in and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. In Unity, the department works closely with National Education of Singapore (NIE) to create &nbsp;authentic experiences like conducting water geographical investigation in the field. Pure Humanities students also embarked on field studies to Johore. We also extend the joy of learning humanities by creating learning experiences through caricature drawing and financial literacy modules for our NT Social Studies students. Technology is also incorporated in our lessons to encourage collaborative learning.
