<h4><strong>School Counselling Information</strong></h4>
<p>Counselling provides our students an opportunity to talk about things
that are of concern to them with a qualified and experienced school counsellor.
Our school counsellors are trained to listen without judging and help students
with the thoughts or feelings that are affecting them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our school-based counselling service provides support for the students
in a place that is familiar, safe and secure. Talking to a school counsellor
can allow the students to explore and understand their problems, and to
find the courage and strength to face and change the circumstance that
they feel so overwhelmed by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For parents who require any advice or additional support for your child,
you may call our General Office at 6767 1070 to request a call back or
email our School Counsellor, Ms Michelle Ong (<a href="mailto:ong_siew_hong@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>ong_siew_hong@moe.edu.sg</u></a>)</p>
