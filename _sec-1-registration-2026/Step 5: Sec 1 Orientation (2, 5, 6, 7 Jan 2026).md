<h3><strong>Step 5: Sec 1 Orientation (2, 5, 6, 7 Jan 2026)</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>As our school runs on a mixed CCA form class structure, Sec 1 students
would be temporarily organised by Orientation Groups (1A, 1B, 1C, etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be 2 teachers assigned to each orientation group to look after
the students’ well-being until the students are assigned their CCA form
class by the end of Week 3.</p>
<h4><strong>Note: School will end at 12:30 pm on 2 Jan, and 2 pm on 5-7 Jan.</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<h4><br><strong>First day of School (2 Jan 2026, Friday)</strong></h4>
<p>All Sec 1 students are to report to the <strong><em>Sheltered Basketball Court by 7.20am </em></strong><em>on </em><strong><em>2 January 2026 (Friday)</em></strong>.
Our Unity Councillors will be at the school’s foyer to direct the Sec 1
students to the reporting venue.</p>
<p>Students are allowed to report in their primary school uniform if the
new uniform is not ready.</p>
<p>If students are unable to report to school on 2 January 2026 due to valid
reasons, please contact our<em> </em><strong><em>General Office</em></strong><em> (</em><strong><em>No: 6767 1070</em></strong><em>)</em> directly.
<br>
</p>
<h4><strong>CCA Open House</strong></h4>
<p>To provide an opportunity for your child to explore the CCAs offered by
the school, we would be conducting the CCA Open House on 2 Jan 2026, 10am
- 12nn, followed by a briefing by our HOD/ CCA on choosing CCA and LEAPS
2.0.</p>

<h4><strong>Orientation Programme (5, 6, 7 Jan 2026)</strong></h4>
<p>To help our students better adjust to secondary school life, we have specially
designed a week of orientation programme for all our Sec 1 students. Academic
lessons will start in week 1 (8 Jan 2026).</p>
