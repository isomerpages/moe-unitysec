<h3><strong>Step 5: Sec 1 Orientation (2, 5, 6, 7 Jan 2026)</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>As our school runs on a mixed CCA form class structure, Sec 1 students
would be temporarily organised by Orientation Groups (1A, 1B, 1C, etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be 2 teachers assigned to each orientation group to look after
the students’ well-being until the students are assigned their CCA form
class by the end of Week 3.</p>
<h4><br><strong>First day of School (2 Jan 2026, Friday)</strong></h4>
<p>All Sec 1 students are to report to the <strong><em>Sheltered Basketball Court by 7.20am </em></strong><em>on </em><strong><em>2 January 2026 (Friday)</em></strong>.
Our Unity Councillors will be at the school’s foyer to direct the Sec 1
students to the reporting venue.</p>
<p>Students are allowed to report in their primary school uniform if the
new uniform is not ready.</p>
<p>If students are unable to report to school on 2 January 2026 due to valid
reasons, please contact our<em> </em><strong><em>General Office</em></strong><em> (</em><strong><em>No: 6767 1070</em></strong><em>)</em> directly.</p>

<p><strong>CCA Open House</strong>
