#### Transition to Secondary School

Your child has arrived at yet another milestone in their life! As they move from primary to secondary school, you might wonder what secondary school life will be like, and how they will adjust to the different environment and routines. 

Your child might also feel anxious as they embark on their secondary school journey. Their anxiety can be turned into excitement if they better prepared for the change and can adapt well to secondary school life – and parents play an important role in helping your child make the transition! 

This [issue of Parent Kit](/files/Resource%20Kit%20-%20Parent%20Kit%20-%20Primary%20to%20Secondary%20Transition.pdf) provides tips on how you can help your child transit smoothly from Primary School to Secondary 1
