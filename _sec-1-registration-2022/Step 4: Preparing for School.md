#### School Expectations

School expectations are set and clearly articulated to inculcate in our students the Unity school values.   
Please click **[here](/our-school/Student-Management/expectations/)** for more information.

#### FAS 

For students who are already on Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) or intent to apply for FAS, please **do not** purchase your books and uniform yet. Please proceed to **[Step 5: Administrative Matters - MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) Application.](https://unitysec-moe-edu-sg-admin.cwp.sg/sec-1-registration-2022/step-5-administration-matters) link isomer**

#### Book Purchase

#### Uniform Purchase

We strongly encourage all students to purchase their school uniform online.

#### Personalized Learning Device

Personal Learning Devices (PLDs)  transforms the learning environment as it allows teachers and students to harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning. The use of the personal learning devices for teaching and learning will support the development of digital literacies in our students as well as develop them as self-directed and collaborative learners.  
  
For more information on the use of PLD in Unity, please click [**here**](https://unitysec-moe-edu-sg-admin.cwp.sg/ndlp-at-unity) **link isomer**.   
  
**By end January 2022, parents/guardians would have received a letter from the school via Parents’ Gateway or hardcopy with details about the PLD.  More information of the device as well as the timeline for receiving the device will be shared through the Parents Engagement Sessions, PG announcements and via the school website updates.**

#### Safe Management Measures

Due to COVID-19 situation, we strongly encourage all students to complete all their purchases online.

**a**. Please note that we can only allow a maximum capacity of 50 parents with their child (**Only one accompanying parent is allowed**) to enter school at any point of time. Safe Management Measures will be in place. All parents will need to check-in the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry, using either the TraceTogether token or app.

If you, your child, or any adult household members are feeling unwell, we seek your understanding and assistance to avoid entering the school premises.

If you still need to come down physically to complete your purchases, do strictly adhere to the following schedule. Do expect a **long waiting time.**
