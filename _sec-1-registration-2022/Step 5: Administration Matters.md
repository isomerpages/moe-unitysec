#### School Counselling Information

Counselling provides our students an opportunity to talk about things that are of concern to them with a qualified and experienced school counsellor. Our school counsellors are trained to listen without judging and help students with the thoughts or feelings that are affecting them.

Our school based counselling service provides support for the students in a place that is familiar, safe and secure. Talking to a school counsellor can allow the students to explore and understand their problems, and to find the courage and strength to face and change the circumstance that they feel so overwhelmed by.

For parents who require any advice or additional support for your child, you may proceed to the general office in school to look for our School Counsellor.  

Please click **[here](/files/Sec%201%20orientation%202022%20updated%2022dec%20(1).pdf)** for more information on our school counselling service.
