<h4>Transition to Secondary School</h4>
<p>Your child has arrived at yet another milestone in their life! As they
move from primary to secondary school, you might wonder what secondary
school life will be like, and how they will adjust to the different environment
and routines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your child might also feel anxious as they embark on their secondary school
journey. Their anxiety can be turned into excitement if they are better
prepared for the change and can adapt well to secondary school life â€“ and
parents play an important role in helping your child make the transition!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue of the <strong><em>Parent Kit </em></strong>provides tips on
how you can help your child transit smoothly from Primary School to Secondary
1.
