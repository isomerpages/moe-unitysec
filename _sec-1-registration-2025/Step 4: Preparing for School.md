<h4>Personalized Learning Device</h4>
<p>Personal Learning Devices (PLDs)&nbsp; transforms the learning environment
as it allows teachers and students to harness technology for greater effectiveness
in teaching and learning. The use of the personal learning devices for
teaching and learning will support the development of digital literacies
in our students as well as develop them as self-directed and collaborative
learners.</p>
<p>For more information on the use of PLD in Unity, please click&nbsp;<strong><a href="/ndlp-at-unity/ndlp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>By end January 2022, parents/guardians would have received a letter from the school via Parents’ Gateway or hardcopy with details about the PLD.&nbsp; More information of the device as well as the timeline for receiving the device will be shared through the Parents Engagement Sessions, PG announcements and via the school website updates.</strong>

<h4>Safe Management Measures</h4>
<p>Due to COVID-19 situation, we strongly encourage all students to complete
all their purchases online.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>. Please note that we can only allow a maximum capacity
of 50 parents with their child (<strong>Only one accompanying parent is allowed</strong>)
to enter school at any point of time. Safe Management Measures will be
in place. All parents will need to check-in the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry,
using either the TraceTogether token or app.</p>
<p>If you, your child, or any adult household members are feeling unwell,
we seek your understanding and assistance to avoid entering the school
premises.</p>
<p>If you still need to come down physically to complete your purchases,
do strictly adhere to the following schedule. Do expect a&nbsp;<strong>long waiting time.</strong>
