</p>
<h4>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)</h4>
<p><strong><u>Purpose of Full SBB</u></strong>
<br>Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning
and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests
of our students. With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education,
with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs. This
is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths
and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and
develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life. This is in line with
our belief in providing opportunities for all our students.</p>
<p><strong><u>Implementation of Full SBB in 2024</u></strong>
<br>By 2024, all secondary schools will have implemented the following aspects
of Full SBB:
<br>• Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum; and&nbsp;
<br>• Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary
2.</p>
<p>Unity Secondary School will be implementing Full SBB in 2024.</p>
<p>• <strong>Mixed Form Classes</strong>
<br>To kick off our Full SBB journey, the 2022 cohort of Secondary 1 students
will be grouped in form classes based on their CCAs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our school sees CCAs as an organic platform for students to interact with
other students taking different subject combinations, and with different
strengths and interests. It presents opportunities for students to mingle,
build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives. The
mixed-class grouping can also help reduce the inadvertent labelling associated
with streaming through carefully designed student development experiences.</p>
<p>The CCA-centric structure will also present opportunities for students’
to develop their leadership competencies as senior CCA leaders will act
as mentors to their junior CCA peers. Such experiences will instill in
students a sense of belonging and responsibility to the school and community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under this new grouping, the CCA teachers will be the students’ Character
Coaches. The role of the Character Coaches is to ensure the total well-being
and character development of the students. They will also monitor the students’
academic progress and school attendance during both curriculum and CCA
time. In our school, every Friday is set aside as ‘Character Day’ for CCA
trainings and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons which will
be conducted by the Character Coaches.</p>
<p>• <strong>Common Curriculum at Lower Secondary</strong>
<br>Besides CCE lessons, all Sec 1 students will attend lessons for the following
common curriculum subjects in mixed classes: Music, Physical Education,
Art, Design and Technology as well as Food and Consumer Education. This
will allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together
in these subjects.</p>
<p>The Common Curriculum subjects are designed to ensure accessibility to
all students. There will be common curriculum coverage and assessment tasks
&amp; rubrics that will allow all students to meet each subject’s requirements.</p>
<p>• <strong>Subject Based Banding</strong>
<br>All Sec 1 Students will have opportunities to do English Language, Mother
Tongue Language, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level, if
they meet subject-specific criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <strong>For Geography, History, Literature, Computer Applications</strong>
<br>Students will attend lessons based on their subject classes. The subject
classes will be organised based on their respective course levels i.e N(T),
N(A) or Express. [*Unity Secondary School will implement FSBB in 2024]</p>
