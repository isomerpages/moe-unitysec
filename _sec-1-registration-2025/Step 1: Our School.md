<h4>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)</h4>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)</strong>
<br>From 2024, all secondary schools will implement Full Subject Based Banding
(SBB).</p>
<p>Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning
and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests
of our students. With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education,
with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs. This
is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths
and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and
develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life. This is in line with
our belief in providing opportunities for all our students.</p>
<p>This means that students will be placed in mixed form classes and will
be able to take a mix of subjects at different subject levels, while attending
some subjects as part of the common curriculum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• <strong>Mixed Form Classes</strong>
<br>In Unity Secondary School, our students are grouped in form classes based
on their CCAs.</p>
<p>Our school sees CCAs as an organic platform for students to interact with
other students taking different subject combinations, and with different
strengths and interests. Through carefully designed student development
experiences, CCA presents opportunities for students to mingle, build meaningful
friendships, and appreciate different perspectives.</p>
<p>The CCA-centric structure will also present opportunities for students’
to develop their leadership competencies as senior CCA leaders will act
as mentors to their junior CCA peers. Such experiences will instill in
students a sense of belonging and responsibility to the school and community.</p>
<p>In Unity Secondary School, teachers guiding the students are known as
Character Coaches. The role of the Character Coaches is to ensure the total
well-being and character development of the students. They will also monitor
the students’ academic progress and school attendance during both curriculum
and CCA time. In our school, every Friday is set aside as ‘Character Day’
for CCA training and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons
which will be conducted by the Character Coaches.</p>
<p>• <strong>Common Curriculum at Lower Secondary</strong>
<br>Besides CCE lessons, all Sec 1 students will attend lessons for the following
common curriculum subjects in mixed classes: Music, Physical Education,
Art, Design and Technology as well as Food and Consumer Education. This
will allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together
in these subjects.</p>
<p>The Common Curriculum subjects are designed to ensure accessibility to
all students. There will be common curriculum coverage and assessment tasks
&amp; rubrics that will allow all students to meet each subject’s requirements.</p>
<p>• <strong>Subject Based Banding</strong>
<br>All Sec 1 Students will have opportunities to do English Language, Mother
Tongue Language, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level, if
they meet subject-specific criteria.&nbsp;</p>
